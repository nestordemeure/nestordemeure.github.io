# My Blog

This is [Nestor Demeure's blog](https://nestordemeure.github.io/).

Note that this is intended more as a collection of pieces of information and texts I like and might want to come back to later than as a blog with posts added periodically.

## Usage

This blog is generated with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

You can preview it locally by running `hugo server`.

To update the online version, just add some content then run `publish.sh`.

To add an image, you can use the following:

```
{{< image src="/writing/essays/pictures/script.jpg" title="image generated with https://app.wombo.art/" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px; max-width: 100%;" >}}
*Image generated with https://app.wombo.art/*
```

Footnotes are automatically turned into sidenotes.
