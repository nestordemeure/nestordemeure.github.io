# My Blog

This is Nestor Demeure's blog, accesible at: [nestordemeure.github.io](https://nestordemeure.github.io/).

Note that this is intended more as a collection of pieces of information and texts I like and would like to find and ponder upon later than as a blog with posts added periodically.

## TODO

- add an icon
- add a picture?
- add categories and make sure they are dealt with properly
