# My Blog

This is [Nestor Demeure's blog](https://nestordemeure.github.io/).

Note that this is intended more as a collection of pieces of information and texts I like and might want to come back to later than as a blog with posts added periodically.

## Usage

To update, just add some content then run `publish.sh`.

## TODO

- add an icon for the blog
- add a picture?
- display categories as rectangles on the main page?
- have a list of posts from newer to older on the main page?
