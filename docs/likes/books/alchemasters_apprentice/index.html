                <p>I just finished reading <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6479198-the-alchemaster-s-apprentice">The Alchemaster&rsquo;s Apprentice by Walter Moers</a>.</p>
<p>Superficially, the book is about a young crat<span class="sidenote"><a class="sidenote-number"></a><small class="sidenote-text">A four legged miaowing animal that has two livers and can talk. <a
class="sidenote-backref">↩︎</a></small></span> dying of hunger in the streets until he makes a Faustian bargain with an alchemaster: for a month he will be feed the best food, taught alchemy and enjoy the best life a crat might want then, at the full moon, he will be <em>killed</em> and rendered for his fat.
The book talks about friendship and love from a wide variety of angles, however, none of this is he point of the book, it is barely the seasoning.</p>
<p>The Alchemaster&rsquo;s Apprentice is subtitled <em>&ldquo;A Culinary Tale from Zamonia by Optimus Yarnspinner&rdquo;</em> because it doubles as a love letter to food.
It includes some of the best descriptions of meals and some of the most imaginative culinary experiences possibles, with additional chapters covering both wine and cheese.
The book cares deeply about the experience of eating, the discoveries that come with new dishes and the joy of sharing those experience with the reader.</p>
<p>The author writes with a deep and communicative joy.
He tells us stories within the story that play with our expectations while managing, until the last moment, to keep us on our toes as to what will happen to our young crat and giving us several <em>hard hitting</em> emotional moments<span class="sidenote"><a class="sidenote-number"></a><small class="sidenote-text">Hitting even harder because it feels like a world where consequences are scarce. Until they aren&rsquo;t. <a
class="sidenote-backref">↩︎</a></small></span>.
Overall, it feels as if a brilliant author decided to dedicate his life to his very personal quirky universe<span class="sidenote"><a class="sidenote-number"></a><small class="sidenote-text">Walter Moers&rsquo;s books happen in a <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/70616-zamonien">shared universe</a> but, similarly to <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/40650-discworld">Terry Pratchett&rsquo;s work</a>, you do not need to have read any of the previous books to enjoy and understand this one. <a
class="sidenote-backref">↩︎</a></small></span>, doing the things he <em>loves</em> rather than the things the public might be looking for.</p>
<p>I would recommend The Alchemaster&rsquo;s Apprentice for pretty much everyone who felt intrigued when reading the above descriptions and all ages.
It is an expertly woven tale of food, love, friendships and storytelling.</p>
