      <description>If you do your groceries on foot1, a shopping trolley bag (with wheels) is a game-changer.
The main hurdle when going grocery shopping on foot is dealing with the weight of the produces on the way back. However, I observed a large number of old people doing their groceries on foot as if it were nothing (while the way back was clearly strenuous to my weak arms).
Their superpower? The power of the wheel!</description>

      <description>The Philips Sonicare toothbrush is the best electronic toothbrush I ever used. By a significant margin. It is not only good at cleaning your teeth but also one of those rare objects that are well designed.
Regarding the quality of the cleaning (arguably the most important criteria), I could feel a sensible reduction in plaque when I went from a traditional toothbrush to an electric toothbrush, but this was one more step.</description>
