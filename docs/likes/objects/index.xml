      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am usually against knife sets; they tend to contain useless knives and suboptimal versions of useful knives, but I absolutely love this set of paring knives&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.victorinox.com/en-US/Products/Cutlery/Paring-Knives/Swiss-Classic-Paring-Knife-Set-3-Pieces/p/6.7116.32&#34;&gt;$22&lt;/a&gt;, it includes a small (paring) knife (useful whenever you want a small sharp knife, i.e., perfect for onion), a serrated slightly longer (tomato) knife (great for smooth vegetables, like tomatoes, as well as a surprising array of small bread, sandwich, and pastries), and a small serrated knife (the least useful of the set, usually used when one of the other two is in washing).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Japanese Can Opener</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The cheapest kind of can opener you can buy in France is a single piece of metal with a sharp edge. It is also the most practical kind of can opener. In the US, it is called a Japanese can opener, and it is apparently &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.epicurious.com/shopping/this-japanese-can-opener-is-my-favorite-cutting-edge-kitchen-tool-article&#34;&gt;very fancy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Those things are a marvel of design. They have no moving parts (it is literally a single piece of metal), making them dead easy to use and clean, very durable (they will outlive you by a long shot), space-efficient (nice if, for whatever reason, you want to travel with your can opener), and dirt cheap (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Japanese-Can-Opener-Ganji-Kankiri/dp/B001TV6A7G&#34;&gt;about $9 on Amazon for a fancier model&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A Shopping trolley bag</title>
      <link>https://nestordemeure.github.io/likes/objects/cabas/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you do your groceries on foot, a shopping trolley bag (with wheels) is a game-changer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The main hurdle when going grocery shopping on foot is dealing with the weight of the produces on the way back.&#xA;However, I observed a large number of old people doing their groceries on foot as if it were nothing (while the way back was clearly strenuous to my weak arms).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Their superpower? The power of the &lt;em&gt;wheel&lt;/em&gt;!&#xA;If you put your produces in a trolley bag, you can carry the heaviest objects (I am talking yogurts, bottles of olive oil, and packs of milk all at the same time) as if they were nothing!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Philips Sonicare toothbrush</title>
      <link>https://nestordemeure.github.io/likes/objects/toothbrush/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Philips Sonicare toothbrush is the best electronic toothbrush I ever used. By a significant margin.&#xA;It is not only good at cleaning your teeth but also one of those rare objects that are well &lt;em&gt;designed&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Regarding the quality of the cleaning (arguably the most important criteria), I could feel a sensible reduction in plaque when I went from a traditional toothbrush to an electric toothbrush, but this was one more step.&#xA;After brushing with an electric toothbrush, I used to be able to feel that there was some plaque left but switching to a Philips Sonicare &lt;em&gt;fully eliminated that sensation&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
