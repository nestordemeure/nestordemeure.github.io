                <p>The cheapest kind of can opener you can buy in France is a single piece of metal with a sharp edge, it is also the most practical kind of can opener.
In the US it is called a Japanese can opener and it is apparently <a href="https://www.epicurious.com/shopping/this-japanese-can-opener-is-my-favorite-cutting-edge-kitchen-tool-article">very fancy</a>.</p>
<p>Those things are a marvel of design, they have no moving parts (it is literally a single piece of metal) making them dead easy to use and clean, very durable (they will outlive you, by a long shot), space-efficient (nice if, for whatever reason, you want to travel with your can opener) and dirt cheap (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Japanese-Can-Opener-Ganji-Kankiri/dp/B001TV6A7G">about $9 on Amazon for a fancier model</a>).</p>
<p>There is simply no good reason to buy the hand-crank models common in the US, get a Japanese can opener and enjoy.</p>
