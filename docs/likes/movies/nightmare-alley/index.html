    content="I watched Guillermo Del Toro&rsquo;s Nightmare Alley yesterday and&hellip; It was ok.
I might have been let down a little because I love both Guillermo Del Toro and the source material (by the way, you can find both the original black&amp;white movie and the book for free, legally, on the internet archive) so I had a lot of expectations.
The actors are solid, the movie has a very nice forties ambiance (I love the psychologist&rsquo;s office design) and some scenes are wonderful (the one scene dealing with the consequence of his actions&hellip; and the final scene which was already one of the strong points from the original story) but I felt that the scenario was lacking. In particular, it gets very very linear and unsurprising once they get out of the carnival (also, I believe all the parts on the main character&rsquo;s father could have been omitted, I suspect it hinders more than it adds to the story).

                <p>I watched <a href="https://youtu.be/Q81Yf46Oj3s">Guillermo Del Toro&rsquo;s Nightmare Alley</a> yesterday and&hellip; It was ok.</p>
<p>I might have been let down a little because I love both Guillermo Del Toro and the source material (by the way, you can find both the original <a href="https://archive.org/details/nightmarealley1947">black&amp;white movie</a> and the <a href="https://archive.org/details/nightmarealley00will/mode/2up">book</a> for free, legally, on the internet archive) so I had a lot of expectations.</p>
<p>The actors are solid, the movie has a very nice forties ambiance (I love the psychologist&rsquo;s office design) and some scenes are wonderful (the one scene dealing with the consequence of his actions&hellip; and the final scene which was already one of the strong points from the original story) but I felt that the scenario was lacking. In particular, it gets very <em>very</em> linear and unsurprising once they get out of the carnival (also, I believe all the parts on the main character&rsquo;s father could have been omitted, I suspect it hinders more than it adds to the story).</p>
<p>Overall, it is nice but a little disappointing. Probably still worth watching if you loved the original or the director.</p>
