      <title>The Taste Gap</title>
      <link>https://nestordemeure.github.io/likes/texts/creative_gap/</link>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Nobody tells this to people who are beginners, I wish someone told me. All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. But there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff, it&amp;rsquo;s just not that good. It&amp;rsquo;s trying to be good, it has potential, but it&amp;rsquo;s not. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And your taste is why your work disappoints you. A lot of people never get past this phase, they quit. Most people I know who do interesting, creative work went through years of this. We know our work doesn&amp;rsquo;t have this special thing that we want it to have. We all go through this. And if you are just starting out or you are still in this phase, you gotta know its normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week you will finish one story. It is only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap, and your work will be as good as your ambitions. And I took longer to figure out how to do this than anyone I&amp;rsquo;ve ever met. It&amp;rsquo;s gonna take awhile. It&amp;rsquo;s normal to take awhile. You&amp;rsquo;ve just gotta fight your way through.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&#xA;— &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ira_Glass&#34;&gt;Ira Glass&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Tower and the Critics</title>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;A man inherited a field in which was an accumulation of old stone, part of an older hall. Of the old stone some had already been used in building the house in which he actually lived, not far from the old house of his fathers. Of the rest he took some and built a tower. But his friends coming perceived at once (without troubling to climb the steps) that these stones had formerly belonged to a more ancient building. So they pushed the tower over, with no little labour, and in order to look for hidden carvings and inscriptions, or to discover whence the man&amp;rsquo;s distant forefathers had obtained their building material. Some suspecting a deposit of coal under the soil began to dig for it, and forgot even the stones. They all said: &amp;lsquo;This tower is most interesting.&amp;rsquo; But they also said (after pushing it over): &amp;lsquo;What a muddle it is in!&amp;rsquo; And even the man&amp;rsquo;s own descendants, who might have been expected to consider what he had been about, were heard to murmur: &amp;lsquo;He is such an odd fellow! Imagine using these old stones just to build a nonsensical tower! Why did he not restore the old house? He had no sense of proportion.&amp;rsquo; But from the top of that tower the man had been able to look out upon the sea.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&#xA;— J.R.R. Tolkien, &lt;a href=&#34;https://jenniferjsnow.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/11790039-jrr-tolkien-beowulf-the-monsters-and-the-critics.pdf&#34;&gt;Beowulf and the Critics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends on his not understanding it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&#xA;— Upton Sinclair, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/262689.I_Candidate_for_Governor&#34;&gt;I, Candidate for Governor: And How I Got Licked&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I affirm that something is safe, good, or necessary, how much of it comes from my salary depending on its success or continuation?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Responsibility of the Poet</title>
      <link>https://nestordemeure.github.io/likes/texts/responsibility/</link>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;We are now inclined to make much of this distinction between amateur and professional, but it is reassuring to know that these words first were used in opposition to each other less than two hundred years ago. Before the first decade of the nineteenth century, no one felt the need for such a distinction &amp;ndash; which established itself, I suppose, because of the industrial need to separate love from work, and so it was made at first to discriminate in favor of professionalism. To those who wish to defend the possibility of good or responsible work, it remains useful today because of the need to discriminate against professionalism.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Solitude! Filth! Ugliness! Ashcans and unobtainable dollars! Children screaming under the stairways! Boys sobbing in armies! Old men weeping in the parks!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Moloch! Moloch! Nightmare of Moloch! Moloch the loveless! Mental Moloch! Moloch the heavy judger of men!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Moloch the incomprehensible prison! Moloch the crossbone soulless jailhouse and Congress of sorrows! Moloch whose buildings are judgment! Moloch the vast stone of war! Moloch the stunned governments!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Rediscovering ideas</title>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Back in my religious days if you independently rediscovered an idea already uncovered by some rabbi 400 years ago it was a big deal and great honor, the whole class would celebrate you. The bigger the rabbi the greater the honor.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&#xA;— &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hormeze/status/1236711366200676352&#34;&gt;@hormeze&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think that this is a very &lt;em&gt;healthy&lt;/em&gt; approach toward the rediscovery of ideas.&#xA;Honoring both the lineage of knowledge and the ability to reach a particular conclusion instead of lamenting the fact that we do not get to reap the benefits of being the first to climb a particular hill.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://nestordemeure.github.io/likes/texts/ozymandias/</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I met a traveller from an antique land,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;Who said—“Two vast and trunkless legs of stone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;Stand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the sand,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;Tell that its sculptor well those passions read&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;And on the pedestal, these words appear:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;Nothing beside remains. Round the decay&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;The lone and level sands stretch far away.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;King Solomon once searched for a cure against depression.&#xA;He assembled his wise men together.&#xA;They meditated for a long time and gave him the following advice:&#xA;Make yourself a ring and have thereon engraved the words &amp;lsquo;This too will pass.&amp;rsquo;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;The King carried out the advice.&#xA;He had the ring made and wore it constantly.&#xA;Every time he felt sad and depressed, he looked at the ring, whereon his mood would change and he would feel cheerful&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;One day a famous government officer met a highly respected elderly master. Being conceited, he wanted to prove that he was the superior person.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As their conversation drew on, he asked the master, &amp;ldquo;Old monk, do you know what I think of you and the things you said?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The master replied, &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t care what you think of me. You are entitled to have your own opinion.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The officer snorted, &amp;ldquo;Well, I will tell you what I think anyway. In my eyes, you are just like a pile of dry shit!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Figures of speech (which you can find &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8zdPz7y5Pwnymik5D7rgI5fTEB__4P1z&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) is a project done &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.illuminationsmedia.co.uk/productions/figures-of-speech/&#34;&gt;illuminations media for the Almeida Theater&lt;/a&gt; in which great actors read great speeches and it is absolutely fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It includes, amongst others, Ian McKellen reading Harvey Milk&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Hope Speech&lt;/em&gt;, Derek Jacobi reading Socrates&amp;rsquo; &lt;em&gt;I Go To Die&lt;/em&gt;, and Noma Dumezweni reading Margaret Sanger&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;The Morality of Birth Control&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The actors are great, the speeches have stood the test of time and it is a great vessel to get familiar with them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro&amp;rsquo;s great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen&amp;rsquo;s Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to &amp;ldquo;order&amp;rdquo; than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&#xA;— Martin Luther King Jr., Letter from a Birmingham Jail&lt;/p&gt;</description>
