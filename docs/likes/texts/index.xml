      <description>One day a famous government officer met a highly respected elderly master. Being conceited, he wanted to prove that he was the superior person.
As their conversation drew on, he asked the master, &amp;ldquo;Old monk, do you know what I think of you and the things you said?&amp;rdquo;
The master replied, &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t care what you think of me. You are entitled to have your own opinion.&amp;rdquo;
The officer snorted, &amp;ldquo;Well, I will tell you what I think anyway.</description>

      <description>Figures of speech (which you can find here) is a project done illuminations media for the Almeida Theater in which great actors read great speeches and it is absolutely fantastic.
It includes, amongst others, Ian McKellen reading Harvey Milk&amp;rsquo;s Hope Speech, Derek Jacobi reading Socrates&amp;rsquo; I Go To Die, and Noma Dumezweni reading Margaret Sanger&amp;rsquo;s The Morality of Birth Control.
The actors are great, the speeches have stood the test of time and it is a great vessel to get familiar with them.</description>

      <description>First they came for the Communists
And I did not speak out
Because I was not a Communist
Then they came for the Socialists
And I did not speak out
Because I was not a Socialist
Then they came for the trade unionists
And I did not speak out
Because I was not a trade unionist
Then they came for the Jews
And I did not speak out
Because I was not a Jew</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro&amp;rsquo;s great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen&amp;rsquo;s Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to &amp;ldquo;order&amp;rdquo; than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice.&amp;rdquo; â€” Martin Luther King Jr., Letter from a Birmingham Jail</description>
