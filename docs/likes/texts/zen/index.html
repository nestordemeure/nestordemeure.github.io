    content=" One day a famous government officer met a highly respected elderly master. Being conceited, he wanted to prove that he was the superior person.
As their conversation drew on, he asked the master, &ldquo;Old monk, do you know what I think of you and the things you said?&rdquo;
The master replied, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what you think of me. You are entitled to have your own opinion.&rdquo;
The officer snorted, &ldquo;Well, I will tell you what I think anyway. In my eyes, you are just like a pile of dry shit!&rdquo;
