He assembled his wise men together.
They meditated for a long time and gave him the following advice:
Make yourself a ring and have thereon engraved the words &lsquo;This too will pass.&rsquo;<br>

<p>This version of the story is closest to the one I was taught, I find it comforting during hard times, reminding me that they are only temporary.</p>
<p>However, the story has several variants, in both <a href="https://ohr.edu/ask_db/ask_main.php/335/Q1/">Jewish</a> and <a href="https://sufi-teachings.tumblr.com/post/97070241755/the-story-behind-this-too-shall-pass-persian">Persian</a> folklore, and they are unanimous on the fact that <em>the sentence works both ways</em>, having the power to remove a smile from a happy man&rsquo;s face.</p>
