</blockquote>
<p>Martin Niemöller was a German Lutheran pastor active when the Nazis rose to power.
Being a conservative, he applauded Hitler&rsquo;s election, finally someone who would <em>make Germany great again</em>.</p>
<p>It took the Nazis threatening the church for him to realize that something was not right and start fighting back.</p>
<p>Interestingly, in 1968 a member of the US congress used a modified version of the poem in which he replaced the <em>&ldquo;communists&rdquo;</em> with the <em>&ldquo;industrialists&rdquo;</em>.
This is particularly ironic because the original poem lists victims of Nazism while the industrialists have both hugely profited from Nazism and actively helped to put Hitler in power&hellip;</p>
