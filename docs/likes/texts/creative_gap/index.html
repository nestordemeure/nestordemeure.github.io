<p>This quote found me as I was trying to articulate my thoughts around <em>taste</em>, putting many of them into better words than I could.</p>
<p>I would only add that, as tools give more and more creative power to individuals, taste becomes an increasingly important asset for producing meaningful and qualitative outputs—whether it’s a piece of art or a piece of code, taste matters across all disciplines.
Producing has never been easier. Being discerning about what we create is getting harder.</p>
