What is mentalism?

</div><p>Mentalism is an ensemble of techniques (including mnemotechnic, hypnosis, magic tricks, knowledge of statistically likely phenomenons, and a trained intuition) used to produce incredible phenomenons (usually psychic phenomenons or an impressive mastery of the human mind) in an entertainment setting.</p>
<p>One point that is worth stressing is that it is <em>neither</em> all real (magic tricks are great to make things look better / add some punch and anyone telling you they don&rsquo;t use them is either lying or very ignorant) <em>nor</em> all fake (anyone telling you otherwise is, similarly, likely ignorant or a magician who did some telepathy-themed tricks and think that it is all there is to it).</p>
<p>If you want to be entertained by a world-class mentalist, I highly recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/OfficialDerren">watching some Derren Brown shorts on YouTube</a>.</p>

</div><p>Usually, people contact me because they want to do a particular demonstration on stage and I find a way to do it given their skill set, constraints, and theme.
But it can also be building a full show around a theme or helping someone track older references on a subject they are researching.</p>
