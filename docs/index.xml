      <description>&lt;p&gt;When reading an assertion, consider the following: the main message, the number of points made, the specific words used and their order, what can be inferred, and how the assertion is proven.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To internalize the assertion, break down the arguments into a logical structure and anticipate potential responses.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Are the premises sufficiently strong or well-supported?&#xA;How can the supporting arguments be confirmed and what examples can be provided?&#xA;With what main idea or argument does it agree or seem to conflict?&#xA;What objections could be raised against it?&#xA;How would the objections explain the core of the text, each paragraph, and the references?&#xA;What does the opposing view assert?&#xA;On how many points does it disagree with?&#xA;How does it prove each point, and from what principle? What are the objections, their form, and the response to each part?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Visiting Provinces</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;First, when arriving in a new region, avoid keeping records that are easily readable by the locals. Instead, write any noteworthy observations, whether positive or negative, in a foreign language. This prevents locals from taking offense if they happen to come across your notes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Second, observe all sacred objects in both public and private spaces, such as the interiors of temples, epitaphs, offerings, tombs of notable figures, and religious symbols and architecture such as organs, columns, and pulpits.&#xA;Additionally, examine fortresses, mountains, forests, valleys, and rivers, noting their characteristics, outpourings, sources, and the origins of their names.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Being Accused</title>
      <link>https://nestordemeure.github.io/writing/translations/breviarum_politicorum/3-acting-society/53-being-accused/</link>

      <guid>https://nestordemeure.github.io/writing/translations/breviarum_politicorum/3-acting-society/53-being-accused/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you notice that someone has accused you, conceal your knowledge of the accusation and do not immediately change your behavior. This way, the informer cannot boast that their accusation was well-received by the Prince or superior they reported to.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Instead, when the opportunity arises, insinuate to the Prince that your accuser is an enemy and an informer. Suggest that informers, like traitors, are useful when needed but should never be truly trusted or loved.&#xA;Argue that if he maligns others in your presence, he will do the same to you in the presence of others, and that there is less prudence and harmony among those who are not allies, but rather critics of each other.&#xA;That even if the Prince finds such men useful, they will eventually reveal their true feelings towards him.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Accusing</title>
      <link>https://nestordemeure.github.io/writing/translations/breviarum_politicorum/3-acting-society/52-accusing/</link>

      <guid>https://nestordemeure.github.io/writing/translations/breviarum_politicorum/3-acting-society/52-accusing/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Avoid being the first to accuse, and refrain from bringing a lawsuit against someone you know the judge favors more than you. Only proceed if you have noticed the judge&amp;rsquo;s opinion shifting in your favor.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you have brought a lawsuit, or one has been brought against you, even if your cause is most just, act as if it were extremely bad.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Approach and influence the judges with gifts, and your adversary through mediators who may meet with him.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Arriving at the Truth</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;To get an honest opinion about your actions, pretend that someone else is describing them, or read about your own deeds as if they were performed by another person. Then ask for opinions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Remember that people have different views, and keep in mind that friends may be more forgiving in their evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you receive measured praise, you can be more confident in the opinion&amp;rsquo;s sincerity, giving some praise is considerate.&#xA;On the other hand, offering no praise, prying into the matter, and disapproving of everything about the deed is unkind.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Avoiding Lending Money</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When lending items, instruct the servant who is delivering them to provide a detailed receipt. Have the servant sign the receipt as if they were acting on their own behalf, without your knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you cannot avoid lending money, consider the following options: claim that you are also in debt or do not have the full amount requested, and ask to borrow something of equal value in return; or explain that you can provide the money without interest if the person offers collateral.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Managing Emotions</title>

      <guid>https://nestordemeure.github.io/writing/translations/breviarum_politicorum/3-acting-society/49-managing-emotions/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you openly display strong emotions or personal feelings for too long, people will eventually oppose your actions.&#xA;Therefore, it is better to refrain from publicly displaying these emotions or behaviors.&#xA;Encourage others who genuinely feel the same way to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, it is best to focus on serious matters to distract yourself from the emotions you wish to eliminate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By doing so, you will conceal your true feelings of anger or happiness from even the most attentive observers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Avoid criticizing someone when they expect praise or are expressing gratitude.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Praise even the smallest deeds, as this encourages diligence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is best to admonish someone through a mutual friend, in a confidential manner.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If someone is involved in illicit loves and you wish to help them break free, keep them occupied with challenging tasks and responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Discreetly arrange for others to criticize the person&amp;rsquo;s words or deeds. Have them report their findings to you, provide false testimony, and disapprove of all the person&amp;rsquo;s actions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When dealing with a serious matter, let others focus on trivial aspects like applause and glory.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If an enemy wishes to surrender a city, offer them the most honorable conditions. Make them believe they are doing you a favor rather than being conquered. Let them depart with their banners unfurled and provide them with all the symbolic trappings of victory. In exchange, ensure that they yield the lands, hand over the captives, and leave behind the gold and fortifications before sunset.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Traveling</title>

      <guid>https://nestordemeure.github.io/writing/translations/breviarum_politicorum/3-acting-society/46-traveling/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Never reveal how much money you have to anyone. If strangers ask about your wealth, always claim to have very little.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Deceive potential thieves as much as you can, and tell no one which direction you are heading. To further conceal your route, ask different people for directions and get varying answers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Beware of joining quarrelers, as they often start fights to distract and rob those who get involved. If someone taunts you, hide your true feelings and remain calm.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you want to remove someone from their position, start by withholding the funds necessary for them to perform their key responsibilities. This will cause the person to incur debts. These debts can then be used as a pretext to justify their removal from office and subsequent punishment. Ensure that the debts are portrayed as illegitimate, so that the creditors themselves may demand repayment from the person, further pressuring them. Thus you have punished the person financially without trouble.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Averting Suspicion</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Read the section titled &lt;em&gt;Gaining Favor&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Avoiding Offense&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Acting Cautiously&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you are suspected of having slandered or discredited some accusers before the Prince, write letters praising them to the Prince, and ensure these letters reach &lt;em&gt;those who suspect you&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, if you wish to vex them, allow genuinely blank letters to be intercepted, making them suspect various secret writing techniques, such as the use of invisible ink that can be revealed by water or heat.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When sympathizing with someone&amp;rsquo;s suffering, console them using common expressions of support, without touching on anything that may offend them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If someone is disparaged in your presence, be most cautious - neither praise nor condemn them. Both are odious.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Always speak well of your superiors, even if they have offended you. When someone else speaks ill of your superiors, do not agree or pretend to agree with them, even if it pleases you to do so.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;People are most deceitful when it comes to giving praise or mockery, flattery or taunts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Collect written satires or mocking texts about you and read them yourself. Also, have others read them and laugh at them, this will cause the author to despair.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Do not reveal a satirical piece written against you. If it must be revealed, invent a reason for doing so.&#xA;However, if the satirical piece must be displayed, take the following steps: read it often at home, learn to laugh at it, and assume appropriate emotions. Imagine that you are mocking it, pretend to have objections, and premeditate fitting responses with an assumed emotion.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Avoid setting strict deadlines for accomplishing tasks, as unforeseen circumstances may arise, causing you to either neglect other matters or become distressed if you are unable to meet your goal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Understand that your subordinates are likely to make mistakes; therefore, avoid over-planning.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Disregard the complaints of your subjects about you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If entrusted with a secret, either decline to accept it or keep it strictly confidential.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Avoid accepting responsibility for others&amp;rsquo; money or belongings.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Be cautious not to let praise lead to comparisons or claims of being unique, even if true, as such statements are rarely believed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If someone openly praises you in the presence of the Prince, ponder whether they have secretly accused you.&#xA;When you receive excessive praise, be cautious. If all your actions are praised, you are thanked for everything, and you are favored above others, be highly suspicious of these flatteries, as it may be a trap.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When dealing with a group, never allow more than one person to address you at a time. Instead, let the group choose a single representative from among themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Inquire into the causes of an uprising. If it is due to usury, lend without interest yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Offer great rewards to whoever quells the sedition, suggests a way to resolve it, eliminates the ringleaders, or betrays them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the people are rebellious or unruly, they must above all be guided towards virtue by good men. Instilling the fear of God and piety is essential, as these alone will make them more compliant.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Do not strike with your own hand, lest you be seen as cruel.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you need to severely punish someone but lack strong justification, consider this approach: First, punish them for a mild offense that you would typically forgive. The offender will resent it and begin to complain and grumble.&#xA;When punished again, he will renew his complaints, until as if obstinate, he will give greater cause for a greater punishment, having been found guilty of a serious offense.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Carry acid, such as burnt wine, and use it to drench clothes stuffed with straw. Suspend these clothes to create a diversion. The guard will believe you acted out of desperation and, neglecting his watch, will spread word to the others. Seize this opportunity to escape.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Feign illness by eating red ochre to simulate bloody stools, pressing near your elbow to alter your pulse, or inducing pallor. Then request that a doctor be summoned. Complain of being fatigued by insomnia. Request to be transferred to the guard&amp;rsquo;s house and to dine with him that day. Ask for a sleeping draught, which you will introduce in your host&amp;rsquo;s drink.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://nestordemeure.github.io/writing/translations/breviarum_politicorum/3-acting-society/36-controlling-anger/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Do not be quick to anger at anyone. Often, you will find that the matter was reported maliciously, or that you misunderstood it. If you act out of anger, the harm will remain with you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If someone wrongs you, it is best to conceal your true feelings. Quarreling only leads to more conflicts and disrupts peace. Even if you emerge victorious, the consequences will be more severe than if you had been defeated, and you will attract more opposition.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If the person objects or makes an excuse, assure them that you will respect their wishes if it becomes evident that assigning them this duty was not in their best interest.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After you have departed, leave behind letters announcing the person&amp;rsquo;s new position. Instruct that these letters be read on a specific date. If the person writes letters back to you, do not respond to them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If they complain, reassure them by saying that they will hold the office for only a short time and will be relieved of their duties soon if it seems appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pretend to be frank, acting as if you speak and act based solely on your own judgment and for the public good, hating nothing more than flattery.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Excuse someone&amp;rsquo;s gentleness and mercy as a duty of piety, to weaken their strictness and severity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Avoid praising someone in a way that openly criticizes others, except perhaps in a crowd with many confused voices.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Leave people&amp;rsquo;s virtues unpraised and overlook their vices.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When ending a friendship, never abruptly break it off, as if you suddenly hate the person due to a perceived slight or offense.&#xA;Instead, having reconciled and showing fervent love, gradually withdraw. To allow the friendship to gently dissolve, gradually reduce the frequency of your meetings. If you must meet, keep the conversations brief and invite them to dinner, acting as if you are burdened by business. This way, it won&amp;rsquo;t seem like you were only pretending to be their friend until you decided to cast them out.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When in the presence of someone whose favor your target seeks or enjoys, praise your target in a way that may turn into an offense to their benefactor.&#xA;Emphasize that you are not expressing your own opinion, mentioning that what you said is commonly rumored. Imply to the benefactor that he should be concerned about his own reputation and that the reputation of those close to them is also at risk. Simultaneously, urge the benefactor to disregard rumors and let trivial matters fade away. However, ensure that they still feel the issue at hand concerns them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you stumble in speech or act thoughtlessly, pretend it was deliberate, to test the judgment of others, or that you misspoke while trying to express something else. Smile as if you achieved your intended goal, or grieve as if you did not.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you have made a mistake due to ignorance, do not ask others about it in a way that reveals your lack of knowledge or error. Plan ahead on how you would seek the truth or ask for others&amp;rsquo; opinions on what they would do in a similar situation. Be sure to conceal your own opinion to avoid being perceived as ignorant.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When betting on an outcome, place an equal bet with another person on the opposite result. This way, regardless of the actual outcome, you will not incur any net loss.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When drafting onerous contracts, incorporate ambiguous terms that allow for broad or narrow interpretation.&#xA;For example, upon a city&amp;rsquo;s surrender, promise to preserve everything if no uprising occurs, without specifying publicly or privately whether this applies to your own soldiers or the city&amp;rsquo;s inhabitants.&#xA;If necessary and fairness demands, you can later reject the agreements.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Consider four things before acting in a novel way:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Consider whether it will be more beneficial or harmful to you?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ask yourself if you possess the necessary abilities or talents?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Consider whether it aligns with your current status?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Consider whether you are respected in your current role?

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pay attention to even the smallest issues. Have your agents immediately report to you any potential sources of harm, so that you can take action before it occurs. Furthermore, ask them to suggest preventive measures.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The rates for buying and selling things should be observed, and experts should be consulted about unknown matters.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Each week, have the steward report on what has been accomplished.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After everyone has gone to bed, assign one person to check that the house is locked and note who is absent.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When hosting a feast, focus on items that can be preserved, such as candied fruits, decorative wax figurines, ornate fountains, artificial mountains, and self-playing musical instruments.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Include artistic elements that are fitting for the occasion, such as wax candelabra covers bearing the coats of arms of your guests, colorful drinks, scented beverages that seem imported from afar, and artificial wines like those described by &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnaldus_de_Villa_Nova&#34;&gt;Arnaldus de Villa Nova&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Present flowers, colored lettuces, giant eggs made from several smaller eggs and seasoned with spices, candles burning from ice, fragrant fires, vomiting mountains, fountains sprinkling snow, and fake fragrant fruits or apples brought to the table on their branch - all things which can grow in your garden at little expense.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Compile examples of emotions and expressions from poetry, such as those found in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_HSr-RWjM08YC&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Palatium Eloquentiae&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and practice the ones you need until you have mastered them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Trust no one, not even your closest friend. When interacting with others, you may pretend to trust them, but always maintain control over your facial expressions and words when showing affection. Remember that your face can reveal as much as your words.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Overcome your own timidity, so that even in moments of self-doubt, you can still act as boldly as you have in similar circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When presented with a request, do not refuse immediately. Instead, engage in some discussion before refusing. Once you have refused, stand firm in your decision. Only concede for serious reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When you are about to refuse a request, take a moment to consider it, then pretend to be sorrowful.&#xA;Alternatively, arrange for letters to be brought to you or have someone announce sad news. To achieve this, instruct a trusted servant to give you a predetermined signal, indicating through gestures and words that you are unable to fulfill the requester&amp;rsquo;s desire.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;First, advise that it would be necessary to bestow offices to someone who fits the description of your accomplishments and circumstances.&#xA;Then, humbly decline the position, as if you were already in a similar one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Strive for good and clear counsel and do many things that are pleasing to the public, such as the construction of public buildings, providing aid to the poor, and implementing measures that can be done without suddenly increasing taxes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Do not despise small gifts and be attentive to losses.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Avoid being wasteful with resources, such as allowing bread, food, or horse feed to go to waste.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Confer with skilled financial advisors and learn their methods.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Consider what can be sold, planted, or produced from your lands. Employ craftsmen to help you achieve these goals.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Know your entire income and always have an eye on your affairs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Before incurring expenses, consider how you can recover an equal amount, so that you don&amp;rsquo;t lose money overall.&#xA;For example, if you decide to give four thousand scudi&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; to valiant soldiers, you should first announce monetary penalties for gamblers and similar vices. This way, the expenditure can be offset by the income from these penalties.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Stage a quarrel with a friend to trick your enemy into believing that you are genuinely at odds with each other. This may prompt your enemy to reveal their true feelings as they attempt to exploit the situation. Then, suddenly resist and oppose the enemy with your friend&amp;rsquo;s combined strength.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This tactic can also be used against robbers planning an ambush on the road or in similar situations. Intentionally make yourself appear vulnerable and approach the ambush site. When the trap is sprung, flee and lure your attackers into a counter-ambush.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Avoid obscene words or actions, as these are the habits of foolish people. Similarly, refrain from mimicking the sounds of birds or other animals.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Never make jokes about things that would embarrass the other person, such as their physical or personality flaws, as these will leave a negative lasting impression.&#xA;Furthermore, avoid speaking about the misfortunes of others, whether they are present or not. It is better to listen to such stories than to tell them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Know yourself and from what background you come.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some people may seem unpleasant to talk to at first, but as you spend more time with them, their wisdom becomes apparent, making the conversation more agreeable.&#xA;Others may appear prudent and learned at first, but over time, they may prove to be flawed in their judgment or without foresight.&#xA;Adapt your interactions based on the type of person you are dealing with. If someone&amp;rsquo;s wisdom emerges gradually, engage in fewer but longer conversations. If they are immediately prudent and learned, interact with them often but briefly, in a way that you find pleasing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Arrange a signal with your servant beforehand. When they receive the signal, have them call you away as if for urgent business. They can whisper in your ear, send a messenger with letters, or announce that harm has been done or that there are disturbances among your subjects.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Have a doctor forbid you from speaking or drinking.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Have a saddled horse brought, as if you were about to depart.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Give oats to your guest&amp;rsquo;s horses, but first shake a wolf skin over them, or provide a stable where a wolf&amp;rsquo;s carcass has been buried.&#xA;This will make them restless.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Being cautious involves two aspects: &lt;em&gt;cautious trust&lt;/em&gt; and a certain &lt;em&gt;generosity&lt;/em&gt;.&#xA;&lt;em&gt;Cautious trust&lt;/em&gt; means being on guard even with friends, as some friendships exist to deceive, and trusting no one without reason to suspect them.&#xA;&lt;em&gt;Generosity&lt;/em&gt;, in this context, means refraining from indiscriminately telling the truth or correcting others&amp;rsquo; errors and habits, while maintaining a pretense of doing so, although this is not entirely harmless.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Entrust a secret to no one, because anyone can become an enemy at any moment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As much as possible, be silent, listen to the advice of others, and carefully weigh it in your mind.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Take care not to be carried away by the passion of love.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Do not value your own words and deeds too highly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Do not occupy yourself with useless matters that will be of no future use.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Do not entangle yourself in the affairs of others.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Freely give others credit for accomplishments, even if you have greatly contributed to the project. By doing so, you will receive even greater recognition in return, without inciting envy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;To encourage someone to act, take responsibility for any potential losses, such as goods or property, and offer specific rewards in return.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, before a battle, a commander should announce compensation for specific injuries, that he will cover their losses in goods and baggage; meanwhile, he should place a strong garrison in the camp, lest concern for it distract the soldiers&amp;rsquo; minds.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you have been reluctant or less generous in granting someone&amp;rsquo;s request, be careful not to be overly generous to others in a similar situation for some time afterward, even if it seems minor.&#xA;Otherwise, you will either arouse distrust towards yourself or incite hatred between the parties involved.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Never increase severity toward those you govern unless you also increase rewards or benefits at the same time; otherwise, you will either incur hatred or contempt. If you increase both severity and rewards, you will mix love with fear.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;First, examine a person&amp;rsquo;s motives and assess whether they are consistent with their claimed actions, typical behavior, or the actions they are suspected of committing.&#xA;Additionally, note if the person is acting more passionately or more cautiously than they typically do.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If a person is not acting in their own interest, or if they abruptly and enthusiastically change their stance, it may indicate that they have been bribed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If a person does not agree after their stated reasons have been thoroughly disproven, they are not genuinely motivated by those reasons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Engage even people of low status in conversation. Overcome by kindness, especially if you grease their palms with gold, they will likely tell you everything you want to know. (You can also gather information by talking with children, but this comes with certain risks.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Set servants against each other, so they will betray each other&amp;rsquo;s secrets.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, it is crucial to always keep your promises to everyone. Failing to do so will cause them to lose trust in you.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Avoid acting as a witness in disputes. Doing so will inevitably offend one side or the other.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Do not speak poorly of anyone, and do not show disdain through your gestures. If you make a scornful remark about someone, continue the conversation as if nothing happened.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the presence of others, do not show special favor to anyone. If you do, those who are not favored will feel despised and begin to hate you.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This produces many compromises, as well as axes of freedom, for the translator (see John D. Niles&amp;rsquo;s excellent &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jstor.org/stable/378784&#34;&gt;Rewriting Beowulf: The Task of Translation&lt;/a&gt; for a discussion on the topic).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Avoid eating too little or too much, and ensure that your food is of good quality.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Dress appropriately for the weather, avoiding excessive heat or cold.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Avoid sleeping, working, or living in uncomfortable or stressful environments.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Do not spend too much time in high altitudes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Overeating and irregular bowel movements are the sources of diseases. Engage in moderate physical activity and rest, and keep your emotions under control.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Do not dwell near swamps or even rivers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Be cautious when trusting prudent men. They may minimize issues related to their own duties and be too generous when judging the reputations of others.&#xA;They will not reveal if anyone has spoken badly about you in their presence, nor whom you should be wary of, or what vices they themselves struggle with.&#xA;The same is true of priests when they praise their penitents, because they can say nothing but good about them, no less than parents about their children.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Like any interpretive work, a translation is the result of a volatile hermeneutic process. Its readers should be wary of accepting it as a record of “what the text says,” for the text says many things, some of them enigmatically.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&#xA;— John D. Niles, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jstor.org/stable/378784&#34;&gt;Rewriting Beowulf: The Task of Translation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The bulk of the translation work was done using Artificial Intelligence (and in particular &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-family&#34;&gt;Claude Opus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The process and prompt I used are detailed below.&#xA;They were born out of a lot of trial and error and are likely still very imperfect (as demonstrated by the fact that I was not able to capture the style I wanted).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;To reprimand someone without them realizing it, begin by discussing unrelated topics. Then, subtly exaggerate and criticize the actions you want to address.&#xA;To obscure the fact that you are reprimanding them, add other details to the conversation. Additionally, frequently encourage them to be positive and cheerful, and include some jokes to lighten the mood.&#xA;If they become sad, inquire about the reason. After discussing their emotional state, add all the other points you want to make at the end, even discussing potential solutions in a general sense.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Then the prince went and sat on a seat by the wall, thoughtfully gazing on the work of giants, how the stone-arches held up the eternal earth-hall from within. His thane, glorious in his victory, washed the blood-stained hand of his lord abundantly with water, the great-hearted man, weary from his battle-wounds, and loosened his helmet.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Beowulf spoke in spite of his injuries, his mortal wound; he knew full well that he had spent his allotted days, his worldly joy; then all was gone for him, the count of his days, death very near: &amp;ldquo;Now I would give my war-gear to my son, if any heir had been granted to me, born of my body. I have ruled this people for fifty winters. There was not one of the neighboring kings who dared meet me with swords, or oppress me with terror. I bided my time in my home, sought out my own fate, quarreled with no one, nor swore many false oaths. For all that I may have joy, though sick with mortal wounds, because the gods need not blame me with the murder of kinsmen, when my life departs from my body.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When asking a friend for a favor, make sure your request doesn&amp;rsquo;t require too much money or effort.&#xA;Instead of directly asking, letting them know that you need help should suffice. If your friend does not provide the favor voluntarily, he will not do so even if you ask directly.&#xA;However, express gratitude for all help provided, as this will subtly convey your desire for further assistance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you are about to request something serious, first discuss other matters and subtly explain your desires as if doing something else.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The dragon guarded a hoard in the high heath, a stone-barrow; a path ran beneath, unknown to men. Inside, a certain man had entered who seized a cup, a gold-plated treasure; he did not give it back, though he had tricked the sleeping guardian with thievish craft. The king found out that his rage was provoked.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It was not by his own desire that the man sought out the dragon&amp;rsquo;s hoard, bringing about woe and destruction; rather, out of dire necessity, a servant, one of some slaves, sought refuge there with a guilty conscience, fleeing heavy blows. Soon he entered, the frightened spirit of the man. There he saw many old treasures lying in that earthen hall, as some man in days of yore, mindful of a noble heritage, had hidden them there, the immense legacy of a high-born race, precious treasures. Death had seized them all in times past, and the only one still living from that people, a warden hoping to delay, longed that he might for a little while enjoy the long-accumulated wealth.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Be generous in giving what you know others will not ask for, or what they will never use, such as privileges.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A teacher should not teach his student everything he knows, in order to maintain the student&amp;rsquo;s desire to learn more.&#xA;Similarly, a parent should not give their child so much that the child no longer needs or hopes for anything more from the parent.&#xA;The same principle applies to a master&amp;rsquo;s relationship with his servant.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Beowulf spoke, the son of Ecgtheow: &amp;ldquo;Lo, son of Healfdene, prince of the Scyldings, we have joyfully brought you this sea-booty, which you gaze on here, as a token of glory. I hardly survived it, hazarded an undersea battle, engaged in a risky task. The fight would soon have been finished if fate had not protected me. I could not accomplish anything with Hrunting in the conflict, though that weapon is strong; but the All-Father granted that I saw a beautiful, powerful sword hanging on the wall. I drew that weapon in battle. Then I slew the guardians of the house in that moment as occasion presented itself. That battle-sword then burned up, that patterned blade, as the blood sprang out, hottest of battle-sweat. I brought the hilt from there as a trophy, avenged the evil deeds, the death-agony of the Danes, as was fitting. I promise you that you may sleep in Heorot free from care with your band of warriors, and each of your thanes, of the tried and true, of the young and old; you need not, prince of the Scyldings, fear for them death-harm from that side, as you did before.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you are writing in a public place, pretend to be copying from another document. Hold up a sheet of paper so others can see it, while keeping your actual writing hidden. Cover your work with a book or another sheet of paper, or position the raised paper so that only the line you appear to be copying is visible to anyone who approaches.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If someone approaches while you are reading, quickly turn to a different page to avoid drawing attention to your focus. It is best to have multiple books combined, allowing you to present one for inspection while concealing the actual book you were reading.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;She came then to Heorot, where the Ring-Danes slept throughout the hall. Misfortune befell the nobles when Grendel&amp;rsquo;s mother burst in upon them. The terror was less only by so much as the strength of women, the war-terror of a wife, is less than an armed man&amp;rsquo;s, when the bound sword, hammer-forged and stained with blood, the keen blade with its edge, cuts the boar on the helmet of the opposed warrior. Then, hard-edged swords were drawn from the benches, many a broad shield lifted fast in hand; they did not think of helm or broad corslet when the terror seized them. She was in haste, wanting to get out from there to save her life when discovered. Quickly, she seized one of the nobles tight, then went to the fen. That man was to Hrothgar the most beloved of heroes in the rank of retainer between the two seas, a mighty shield-warrior, whom she killed on his resting place, a war-renowned fighter. Beowulf was not there; another lodging had been assigned earlier, after the gift-giving, to the mighty Geat. An outcry arose in Heorot. She had taken the bloody hand in her fierce grip. Grief was renewed again in the dwellings. That was no good bargain, which they on both sides had to pay for with lives of friends.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the morning, as I have heard, many a warrior gathered around the gift-hall. Tribal chiefs came from far and wide over distant paths to behold the wonder, the tracks of the enemy. His parting from life did not seem grievous to any of the men who saw the splendor of the inglorious one&amp;rsquo;s footprints, how he, weary in spirit and overcome in the fight, doomed and driven out, bore his death-marks to the mere of the water-monsters. There, the water seethed with blood, the terrible swirling of the waves all mingled with hot gore, with sword-blood; the death-doomed one dyed it when, deprived of joy, he laid down his life in his fen-refuge, where hell received him.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Treat any friend as if he may one day become your enemy.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It is dangerous for a single individual to become too powerful within any group or organization.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;When you desire something, let no one notice your intentions until you have obtained it.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Stay vigilant and anticipate potential pitfalls to prevent them from occurring.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Resolve matters through peaceful means whenever possible, avoiding war or disputes.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Accept small losses instead of risking everything for potentially significant but uncertain gains.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Acting too rashly or aggressively is risky.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The best approach is to take a moderate approach and avoid extremes.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Know all things, reveal nothing; treat everyone with courtesy, but be cautious about acting too openly or candidly with others.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It is advantageous to remain neutral between opposing groups or parties.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Be skeptical towards all and do not expect preferential treatment.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Even if you do not follow the majority&amp;rsquo;s position, do not criticize it.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Be cautious about blindly following your passions, as they may lead you astray or cloud your judgment.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Plan giving gifts and feasting as if you were planning a military campaign.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Revealing a secret can be more dangerous than holding captive an enemy plotting against your life.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;</description>

      <title>III. Beowulf</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the beer-hall, a bench was cleared for the Geats to sit together, the stout-hearted ones proud in their strength. A thane did his duty, bearing in his hands the decorated ale-cup, pouring out the bright sweet drink. At times, a clear-voiced scop sang in Heorot, and there was joy among the heroes, a great host of Danes and Weders.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unferth, son of Ecglaf, who sat at the feet of the Scyldings&amp;rsquo; lord, spoke, unbinding a battle-rune. Beowulf&amp;rsquo;s journey, the brave seafarer&amp;rsquo;s quest, was a great vexation to him, for he would not allow that any other man under the heavens could achieve more glory than himself. &amp;ldquo;Are you that Beowulf,&amp;rdquo; he asked, &amp;ldquo;who strove with Breca on the open sea, competing at swimming? For pride, you two tested the waters, risking your lives in the deep for a foolish boast. No one, friend or foe, could dissuade you from that sorrowful journey when you swam out into the sea. You enfolded the ocean streams with your arms, traversed the water-tracks, tossed with your hands, gliding over the turbulent waves and surges of winter. In the water&amp;rsquo;s power, you toiled seven nights. He overcame you, having more strength. The morning sea cast him up on the land of the Heatho-Reames, from where he, beloved of his people, sought his dear homeland, the Brondings&amp;rsquo; country, his fair stronghold, his folk, city, and treasures. Beanstan&amp;rsquo;s son truly fulfilled his boast against you. So I expect a worse result for you, even if you have prevailed in every battle-rush and grim fight, if you dare await Grendel for the space of a night.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Never assume that someone will keep a secret if you act or speak too freely or confidently in their presence, even if they are a child or servant. They will judge you by this action and describe you accordingly to others.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Never assume that someone will excuse your questionable behavior; in fact, they will likely interpret it in the worst possible way. To prevent this, avoid engaging in any actions that could be seen as questionable, even if there is only one witness.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>II. Grendel</title>
      <link>https://nestordemeure.github.io/writing/translations/beowulf/2-grendel/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At dawn, as day broke, Grendel&amp;rsquo;s deeds were laid bare. After their feasting, wailing filled the morning air, a great cry of sorrow. The renowned ruler, long good and noble, sat joyless, the strong one suffering for his thanes as they beheld the loathsome foe&amp;rsquo;s track, the accursed spirit&amp;rsquo;s trail. That struggle was too strong, too long-lasting and loathsome.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After a single night, Grendel wrought more slaughter, not shrinking from his evil, firmly set in his ways. It was easy to find one who sought rest elsewhere, a bed among the hall-bowers, when the hellish fiend&amp;rsquo;s hate was clearly shown by a sign. Thereafter, those who escaped kept a safer distance. Against right, one against all, Grendel ruled and fought until the best of houses stood empty. Twelve long winters the Scyldings&amp;rsquo; friend suffered, enduring immense sorrows. Through sad songs, it became known to all that Grendel long warred with Hrothgar, his violence, enmity, and ceaseless strife spanning many half-years. He wanted no peace, nor would he withdraw his life-bale or accept tribute. No wise counselor could expect bright compensation from the slayer&amp;rsquo;s hands. The dark death-shadow pursued both old and young, lurking, waiting, ruling the misty moors by night. Men know not where such hellish demons wander on their errands. Thus, the foe of mankind, the awful lone roamer, often committed many crimes and harsh humiliations. He dwelt in Heorot on the dark nights, yet could not approach the gift-throne, feeling no warmth of kinship.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The renowned ruler, a noble long good, sat empty of joy; the strong one suffered, sorrowing for his thanes, when they beheld the track of the loathsome foe, the accursed spirit.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Listen well! Let me tell you of the glory of the Spear-Danes&amp;rsquo; kings in days long past, and the valorous deeds of those mighty princes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Scyld Scefing, abandoned as a child, rose to seize the mead-benches from many tribes and troops of enemies. From this, he found solace. He grew under the heavens, thriving with honors, until each nation across the whale-road had to obey him and pay tribute. That was a good king!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From the beginning to the introduction of Grendel.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Lo! We have heard of the glory of the Spear-Danes&amp;rsquo; kings in days of yore - how those princes did valorous deeds! Often Scyld Scefing seized the mead-benches from many tribes, from troops of enemies, though he had first been found abandoned [this is important, he came from nothing like a lot of our characters]. He experienced solace for that - he grew under the heavens, thrived with honors, until each of the encircling nations over the whale-road had to obey him and pay tribute. That was a good king!

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you praise someone and a listener remains silent in response, it indicates that the listener is not truly the praised person&amp;rsquo;s friend.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can also tell that a person is not another&amp;rsquo;s friend if they respond to your praise in certain ways. These include diverting the conversation elsewhere, speaking halfheartedly or reluctantly, diminishing the praise, claiming the story is inconsistent, attributing part of the praise to others, or failing to enhance your praise despite knowing about a praiseworthy deed.&#xA;Other indications that a person is not a genuine friend include: dismissing a deed as a chance occurrence, attributing it to God&amp;rsquo;s extraordinary providence, claiming that others have accomplished equal or greater feats, or suggesting that it was achieved through the counsel of another.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Much can be learned about someone&amp;rsquo;s true character in situations like sickness, drunkenness, gain or loss of money, games, and travel. When the doors of the mind are relaxed, the wild beasts more readily emerge from their dens.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Pay attention to how people behave during times of affliction, especially when they are insulted or facing other challenges. Interact with those you wish to know better during these situations to gain insights into their character.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;[E]ach computer attends only to one equation or part of an equation. The work of each region is coordinated by an official of higher rank. Numerous little &amp;rsquo;night signs&amp;rsquo; display the instantaneous values so that neighbouring computers can read them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[&amp;hellip;] From the floor of the pit a tall pillar rises to half the height of the hall. It carries a large pulpit on its top. In this sits the man in charge of the whole theatre; he is surrounded by several assistants and messengers. One of his duties is to maintain a uniform speed of progress in all parts of the globe. In this respect he is like the conductor of an orchestra in which the instruments are slide-rules and calculating machines.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Taste Gap</title>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Nobody tells this to people who are beginners, I wish someone told me. All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. But there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff, it&amp;rsquo;s just not that good. It&amp;rsquo;s trying to be good, it has potential, but it&amp;rsquo;s not. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And your taste is why your work disappoints you. A lot of people never get past this phase, they quit. Most people I know who do interesting, creative work went through years of this. We know our work doesn&amp;rsquo;t have this special thing that we want it to have. We all go through this. And if you are just starting out or you are still in this phase, you gotta know its normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week you will finish one story. It is only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap, and your work will be as good as your ambitions. And I took longer to figure out how to do this than anyone I&amp;rsquo;ve ever met. It&amp;rsquo;s gonna take awhile. It&amp;rsquo;s normal to take awhile. You&amp;rsquo;ve just gotta fight your way through.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&#xA;— &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ira_Glass&#34;&gt;Ira Glass&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Okonomiyaki</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Okonomiyaki, which roughly translates to &amp;ldquo;anything grilled,&amp;rdquo; can be described as a Japanese cabbage and seafood-flavored pancake. But, that is very much off the mark as to what the dish is: think of a grilled disk of cabbage and batter, coated in a sweet sauce, and Japanese mayo. It is heaven and surprisingly easy to make.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;heading-wrapper&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;h2 id=&#34;ingredients-1-okonomiyaki&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;a class=&#34;heading-anchor&#34; href=&#34;#ingredients-1-okonomiyaki&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none&#34;&gt;&#xA;            Ingredients (1 Okonomiyaki):&#xA;        &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Batter:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;76 grams flour&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;1/8 teaspoon&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; of baking powder&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;1/4 teaspoon of salt&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;2 eggs&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;60 ml of warm water&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;bonito flakes&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;1/2 teaspoon soy sauce&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;1/4 of a head of cabbage&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;1/4 of a red&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; onion&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sauce&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Like most puff pastry recipes, this recipe feels like cheating. It is super easy to do yet looks fantastic. Plus, if for some weird reason you do not want a &lt;em&gt;giant&lt;/em&gt; almond croissant, you can easily adapt it to oddly shaped leftover puff pastry bits and stale croissants.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;heading-wrapper&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;h2 id=&#34;ingredients-12-servings&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;a class=&#34;heading-anchor&#34; href=&#34;#ingredients-12-servings&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none&#34;&gt;&#xA;            Ingredients (12 servings):&#xA;        &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;one sheet of puff pastry&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;,&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;56 grams of salted butter,&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;100 grams of white sugar,&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;108 grams of almond flour&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;,&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;1 large egg,&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;1 tablespoon vanilla extract,&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;1.5 teaspoons almond extract,&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;45 grams sliced almonds.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;heading-wrapper&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;h2 id=&#34;preparation&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;a class=&#34;heading-anchor&#34; href=&#34;#preparation&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none&#34;&gt;&#xA;            Preparation:&#xA;        &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;heading-wrapper&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;h4 id=&#34;puff-pastry&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;a class=&#34;heading-anchor&#34; href=&#34;#puff-pastry&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none&#34;&gt;&#xA;            Puff pastry&#xA;        &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;thaw your puff pastry&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;,&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;unfold the puff pastry on a baking tray,&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;bake it at 425°F for 10 minutes,&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;bake it for an additional 25 minutes at 350°F&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;heading-wrapper&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;h4 id=&#34;frangipane&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;a class=&#34;heading-anchor&#34; href=&#34;#frangipane&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none&#34;&gt;&#xA;            Frangipane&#xA;        &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;melt the butter,&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;mix the butter and sugar,&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;add the egg, almond flour, vanilla, and almond extract,&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;mix until combined.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;heading-wrapper&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;h4 id=&#34;assembly&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;a class=&#34;heading-anchor&#34; href=&#34;#assembly&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none&#34;&gt;&#xA;            Assembly&#xA;        &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;split the puff pastry into 2 layers,&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;spread 2/3 of the frangipane on the bottom layer (the filling),&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;put the top layer back on it,&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;spread the leftover frangipane on it,&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;sprinkle the sliced almonds on top.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;heading-wrapper&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;h4 id=&#34;baking&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;a class=&#34;heading-anchor&#34; href=&#34;#baking&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none&#34;&gt;&#xA;            Baking&#xA;        &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;bake at 350°F for 20 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;heading-wrapper&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;h2 id=&#34;credits&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;a class=&#34;heading-anchor&#34; href=&#34;#credits&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none&#34;&gt;&#xA;            Credits:&#xA;        &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This recipe is my take on &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/wvt0TkhO1CI&#34;&gt;Sohla El-Waylly&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Giant Almond Croissant recipe&lt;/em&gt; on the New York Times Cooking channel&lt;/a&gt;.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am usually against knife sets; they tend to contain useless knives and suboptimal versions of useful knives, but I absolutely love this set of paring knives&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.victorinox.com/en-US/Products/Cutlery/Paring-Knives/Swiss-Classic-Paring-Knife-Set-3-Pieces/p/6.7116.32&#34;&gt;$22&lt;/a&gt;, it includes a small (paring) knife (useful whenever you want a small sharp knife, i.e., perfect for onion), a serrated slightly longer (tomato) knife (great for smooth vegetables, like tomatoes, as well as a surprising array of small bread, sandwich, and pastries), and a small serrated knife (the least useful of the set, usually used when one of the other two is in washing).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have always been a big reader. For a long time, that meant having to buy or borrow the books I was interested in, always carrying one or two books with me, then ending up with shelves of books that have been of interest to me once but would now be best &lt;a href=&#34;https://littlefreelibrary.org/&#34;&gt;donated away&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This led to an interest in &lt;em&gt;ebooks&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;heading-wrapper&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;h2 id=&#34;why-read-ebooks&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;a class=&#34;heading-anchor&#34; href=&#34;#why-read-ebooks&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none&#34;&gt;&#xA;            Why read ebooks?&#xA;        &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I see several key advantages to ebooks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Tower and the Critics</title>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;A man inherited a field in which was an accumulation of old stone, part of an older hall. Of the old stone some had already been used in building the house in which he actually lived, not far from the old house of his fathers. Of the rest he took some and built a tower. But his friends coming perceived at once (without troubling to climb the steps) that these stones had formerly belonged to a more ancient building. So they pushed the tower over, with no little labour, and in order to look for hidden carvings and inscriptions, or to discover whence the man&amp;rsquo;s distant forefathers had obtained their building material. Some suspecting a deposit of coal under the soil began to dig for it, and forgot even the stones. They all said: &amp;lsquo;This tower is most interesting.&amp;rsquo; But they also said (after pushing it over): &amp;lsquo;What a muddle it is in!&amp;rsquo; And even the man&amp;rsquo;s own descendants, who might have been expected to consider what he had been about, were heard to murmur: &amp;lsquo;He is such an odd fellow! Imagine using these old stones just to build a nonsensical tower! Why did he not restore the old house? He had no sense of proportion.&amp;rsquo; But from the top of that tower the man had been able to look out upon the sea.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&#xA;— J.R.R. Tolkien, &lt;a href=&#34;https://jenniferjsnow.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/11790039-jrr-tolkien-beowulf-the-monsters-and-the-critics.pdf&#34;&gt;Beowulf and the Critics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a kid, I knew that there were wolves in the dark. Scrawny wolves walking naked on their hind legs. Wolves that talk to you before eating you, but wolves nonetheless. Wolves you forget as soon as they leave your field of vision.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At night, I would turn the lights on, progressively, carefully, as I went from my bedroom, through a corridor, down the stairs, by the underground cellar, to the toilets.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I absolutely love this recipe. It is dead easy, legitimately 2 ingredients &amp;ndash; the leek juice and melted cheese combining to make the sauce &amp;ndash;, delicious but unlikely to weight you down.&#xA;Very much worth cooking when leeks are in season, and you want something warm and cheesy to pick up your soul.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;heading-wrapper&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;h2 id=&#34;ingredients&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;a class=&#34;heading-anchor&#34; href=&#34;#ingredients&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none&#34;&gt;&#xA;            Ingredients:&#xA;        &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;2 big leeks&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;1 full&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Roblochon&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;heading-wrapper&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;h2 id=&#34;cooking&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;a class=&#34;heading-anchor&#34; href=&#34;#cooking&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none&#34;&gt;&#xA;            Cooking:&#xA;        &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cut the leeks into 1cm slices then cook them in salted water until they reach your favorite consistency&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;drain the leeks carefully in a colander then transfer them to the bottom of you cooking pan&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;put a layer of cheese slices on top of the leeks&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;cook in an oven at 350F (180C) until the cheese is melted or crispy to your preference&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;eat hot&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;heading-wrapper&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;h2 id=&#34;credits&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;a class=&#34;heading-anchor&#34; href=&#34;#credits&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none&#34;&gt;&#xA;            Credits:&#xA;        &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This particular take on the recipe came straight from a French book of recipe whose name sadly escapes me at the moment.&#xA;The recipe diverges from the vast majority of gratins in that it does not have a carb, making it significantly lighter on the stomach.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failure_of_imagination&#34;&gt;failure of imagination&lt;/a&gt; usually refers to a bad outcome which, despite being predictable, is not imagined and thus not planned for.&#xA;However, I use the expression in a more positive light, to speak of a good outcome that, despite being possible, is not imagined and thus not explored.&#xA;I know of two failures of imagination:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first failure of imagination is &lt;em&gt;imagining that something is impossible&lt;/em&gt; without actual proof. Even given proof that something is impossible, one should be attentive to the hypotheses that went into the proof, as well as to what exactly has been proven impossible&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;We are now inclined to make much of this distinction between amateur and professional, but it is reassuring to know that these words first were used in opposition to each other less than two hundred years ago. Before the first decade of the nineteenth century, no one felt the need for such a distinction &amp;ndash; which established itself, I suppose, because of the industrial need to separate love from work, and so it was made at first to discriminate in favor of professionalism. To those who wish to defend the possibility of good or responsible work, it remains useful today because of the need to discriminate against professionalism.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Jim started digging at the crossroad. He felt heavy, he wasn’t quite sure if it was the pasta or the meat, but eating before coming was probably a bad idea… but it&amp;rsquo;s not as if he had experience with this stuff.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once the hole was big enough, he wrapped a silver dollar in one original page of Krazy Kat and buried it in the dirt. Then, he waited.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A fly started to bother him. Hopefully, a sign of success. Maybe, a sign that someone somewhere had received the offerings. Maybe, just a fly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s be frank. Everything we know about Cardinal Mazarin (apart from his name in history textbooks glimpsed towards the end of the Thirty Years&amp;rsquo; War) comes from &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty_Years_After&#34;&gt;Dumas&amp;rsquo; &lt;em&gt;Twenty Years After&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. A particularly odious cardinal, a sinister individual, a scoundrel and simulator compared to his eminent predecessor, the great Richelieu who knew how to defeat his enemies and grant a musketeer&amp;rsquo;s commission to those who deserved it, Mazarin lies, breaks his word, is reluctant to pay his debts, has the Duke of Beaufort&amp;rsquo;s dog, trained to bark at him, poisoned. An Italian rascal, whom Beaufort calls &amp;ldquo;the most illustrious scoundrel Mazarin&amp;rdquo;. He is a villain, a perjurer, a coward who sneaks, at nightfall, into the bed of Anne of Austria, who in earlier times had known how to love men of Buckingham&amp;rsquo;s caliber. Is it possible that Mazarin was such a scoundrel? We knew that Dumas, when describing historical figures, did not invent: he added color, staged, but was very attentive to sources, chronicles, memorialists, even for imaginary characters; so, you can imagine, a man of the stature of Mazarin! Therefore, we read with complete confidence.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This text, written in collaboration with ChatGPT, is&lt;/em&gt; not &lt;em&gt;about an AI taking over the world.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hana, the head of the software development team, reclined in her chair, seeking a brief respite from her work. She absentmindedly clicked on her Reddit bookmark, hoping for a few minutes of distraction. To her surprise, the site was unresponsive. As if on cue, Tom, one of her engineers, strode towards her desk, exuding an unmistakable air of urgency. &amp;ldquo;Hana, we&amp;rsquo;ve stumbled upon a critical issue,&amp;rdquo; he murmured, his voice barely audible.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This recipe is simple, tastes good, has an interesting texture and, more importantly, looks extremely weird making it a fantastic party dessert.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;heading-wrapper&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;h2 id=&#34;ingredients-one-rectangular-cake-pan&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;a class=&#34;heading-anchor&#34; href=&#34;#ingredients-one-rectangular-cake-pan&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none&#34;&gt;&#xA;            Ingredients (one rectangular cake pan):&#xA;        &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;2 (very ripe) avocados&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;100 grams of sugar&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;3 eggs&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;240 grams of flour&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;6 grams (one and a half) teaspoon of baking powder&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;heading-wrapper&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;h2 id=&#34;preparation&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;a class=&#34;heading-anchor&#34; href=&#34;#preparation&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none&#34;&gt;&#xA;            Preparation:&#xA;        &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;dice the inside of the avocados and put them in a large bowl&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;cream&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; the avocados and sugar together&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;beat the eggs into the mix&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;add the flour and baking powder&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;fold together&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;heading-wrapper&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;h2 id=&#34;cooking&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;a class=&#34;heading-anchor&#34; href=&#34;#cooking&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none&#34;&gt;&#xA;            Cooking:&#xA;        &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;cook for 30 to 35 minutes in a 350F (180C) oven&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;heading-wrapper&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;h2 id=&#34;credits&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;a class=&#34;heading-anchor&#34; href=&#34;#credits&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none&#34;&gt;&#xA;            Credits:&#xA;        &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recipe comes from &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/LrPGbyXEUCw&#34;&gt;Dylan Hollis&amp;rsquo;s excellent Youtube channel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“As an artist I have knocked about among all sorts and conditions of people. I know life as darling Miss Marple here cannot possibly know it.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I recently finished reading Agatha Christie&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18965870-the-tuesday-night-club&#34;&gt;The Tuesday Night Club&lt;/a&gt; and it is surprisingly sharp.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A group of friends (a writer, an artist, a clergyman, a lawyer and a police commissioner) is having a late-night discussion, hosted by the old aunt of one of the members.&#xA;One of them theorizes that some crimes stay unsolved because policemen are all very similar in character which leaves them with blind spots.&#xA;Following their theory, the current group should do much better at solving crimes due to their &lt;em&gt;diversity&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Those cookies are very worth doing.&#xA;They focus the flavor on the red bean paste while looking fancier than they are difficult to cook (which is always a good thing).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;heading-wrapper&#34;&gt;&#xA;

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Back in my religious days if you independently rediscovered an idea already uncovered by some rabbi 400 years ago it was a big deal and great honor, the whole class would celebrate you. The bigger the rabbi the greater the honor.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&#xA;— &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hormeze/status/1236711366200676352&#34;&gt;@hormeze&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think that this is a very &lt;em&gt;healthy&lt;/em&gt; approach toward the rediscovery of ideas.&#xA;Honoring both the lineage of knowledge and the ability to reach a particular conclusion instead of lamenting the fact that we do not get to reap the benefits of being the first to climb a particular hill.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1488589/&#34;&gt;Guillermo Del Toro&amp;rsquo;s Pinocchio&lt;/a&gt; is surprisingly both a very faithful rendition of the original story and a very Del Toro movie.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It has a lot of Del Toro&amp;rsquo;s elements (older spirits meddling with human life, a found family, a refusal to glorify war and fascism as a background) but, if you did not know that it was a Del Toro movie, you would accept all of those elements as coming from the original material.&#xA;It feels like he has found an existing story that meshes very well with his personality and interests.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pizza is a classic for a reason. A lot of recipes call for preparing the dough on a previous day or a special oven, this recipe steers away from those best practices to give you something delicious within two hours.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;heading-wrapper&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;h2 id=&#34;ingredients-one-pizza&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;a class=&#34;heading-anchor&#34; href=&#34;#ingredients-one-pizza&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none&#34;&gt;&#xA;            Ingredients (one pizza):&#xA;        &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;250 grams of flour&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;6 grams of salt&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;4 grams of dry yeast (about half a packet)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;175 grams of warm water&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;15 grams of olive oil (enough to coat the pan)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;heading-wrapper&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;h2 id=&#34;preparation&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;a class=&#34;heading-anchor&#34; href=&#34;#preparation&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none&#34;&gt;&#xA;            Preparation:&#xA;        &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;heading-wrapper&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;h4 id=&#34;dough&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;a class=&#34;heading-anchor&#34; href=&#34;#dough&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none&#34;&gt;&#xA;            Dough&#xA;        &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;mix the flour, salt and yeast in a big bowl&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This drink is quick and easy to make, tastes like an &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.meilleurduchef.com/en/recipe/coffee-eclairs.html&#34;&gt;éclair au café&lt;/a&gt;, and looks very pretty.&#xA;It is perfect to share with a guest who likes coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;heading-wrapper&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;h2 id=&#34;ingredients-1-glass&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;a class=&#34;heading-anchor&#34; href=&#34;#ingredients-1-glass&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none&#34;&gt;&#xA;            Ingredients (1 glass):&#xA;        &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;two teaspoons of instant coffee&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;two teaspoons of sugar&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;two teaspoons of boiling water&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;one glass of &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; cold whole&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; milk&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;heading-wrapper&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;h2 id=&#34;preparation&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;a class=&#34;heading-anchor&#34; href=&#34;#preparation&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none&#34;&gt;&#xA;            Preparation:&#xA;        &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;mix the instant coffee, sugar, and boiling water in a bowl&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;whip until the color lightens and the texture becomes fluffier&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;pour the coffee foam&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; on top of a glass of very cold milk&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;to serve add a straw, let guests mix, and start drinking&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;heading-wrapper&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;h2 id=&#34;credits&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;a class=&#34;heading-anchor&#34; href=&#34;#credits&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none&#34;&gt;&#xA;            Credits:&#xA;        &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This recipe was inspired by seeing &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/WHmpgMsW-aA&#34;&gt;James Hoffman discuss the drink on his youtube channel&lt;/a&gt;.&#xA;I highly recommend his videos for people with an analytical interest in coffee.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://nestordemeure.github.io/cooking/savoury/weekday_meal/pasta_spinash/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This dish is relatively easy to cook while bringing some very strong flavors and colors to the table.&#xA;I highly recommend it if you want a weeknight meal that feels slightly fancier than it should be.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;heading-wrapper&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;h2 id=&#34;ingredients-for-two-portions&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;a class=&#34;heading-anchor&#34; href=&#34;#ingredients-for-two-portions&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none&#34;&gt;&#xA;            Ingredients (for two portions):&#xA;        &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;160 grams of spaghetti&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; (80 grams per person)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;some olive oil&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;a generous amount of pepper&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;some salt&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;a large bowl packed full of fresh baby spinach&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;the equivalent of one and a half large cloves of garlic&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;about 30 grams of butter&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;some grated parmesan&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;heading-wrapper&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;h2 id=&#34;preparation&#34;&gt;&#xA;

   &lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;rince the spinach and dice them very finely&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;crush the garlic&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;dice the butter&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;heading-wrapper&#34;&gt;&#xA;

class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;add the pasta when the water starts boiling and keep cooking for about 10 minutes (until your pasta is cooked)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;heading-wrapper&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;h4 id=&#34;spinach&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;a class=&#34;heading-anchor&#34; href=&#34;#spinach&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none&#34;&gt;&#xA;            Spinach&#xA;        &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;put the olive oil in a wok&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;add a very generous amount of pepper and cook on high heat until the pepper becomes fragrant&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;add the finely diced spinach (roughly when you add the pasta to its water) and a big pinch of salt&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;let simmer on medium to low heat until the pasta is ready&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;heading-wrapper&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;h4 id=&#34;assembly&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;a class=&#34;heading-anchor&#34; href=&#34;#assembly&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none&#34;&gt;&#xA;            Assembly&#xA;        &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;once the pasta is cooked, add a splash of pasta water to the wok, this will help with the consistency of the sauce&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;strain the pasta and add them to the wok (it is fine if there is some pasta water left with the pasta, we added pasta water to the wok anyway)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;add the crushed garlic and diced butter&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;start mixing on high heat&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;once it is fairly well mixed, sprinkle grated parmesan as you would cover a similar amount of pasta in a plate&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;mix constantly on high heat until you reach the desired consistency (I recommend aiming for slightly more liquid than your sweet spot, the sauce will thicken further once served) and all the cheese has dissolved into the sauce&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;salt to taste&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;heading-wrapper&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;h2 id=&#34;credits&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;a class=&#34;heading-anchor&#34; href=&#34;#credits&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none&#34;&gt;&#xA;            Credits:&#xA;        &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this dish&amp;rsquo;s name is the combination of &lt;em&gt;Spaghetti Aglio E Olio&lt;/em&gt; and the Italian word for spinach, it is inspired by wanting to do a pasta dish with spinach and having seen &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/ntZebCEnjmI?list=PL_f8scwrXT8ut7l5Pu8x-YbWsLGo1uWsx&#34;&gt;this Cacio E Pepe recipe&lt;/a&gt; recently.&#xA;The desire to do a pasta dish with spinach and garlic was born from remembering a surprisingly good spinach and garlic dish I had a few years ago.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a very straightforward chocolate brownies recipe.&#xA;You can pimp it up with some coffee powder&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, a few salt flakes on top, any kind of nuts, chocolate chunks, etc.&#xA;The world is your chocolate-flavored oyster!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;heading-wrapper&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;h2 id=&#34;ingredients-8-slices&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;a class=&#34;heading-anchor&#34; href=&#34;#ingredients-8-slices&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none&#34;&gt;&#xA;            Ingredients (8 slices):&#xA;        &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;100 grams of flour&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;37 grams of cocoa powder&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;125 grams of sugar&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;2 eggs&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;1 teaspoon of vanilla extract (optional)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;100 grams of salted butter&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;heading-wrapper&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;h2 id=&#34;preparation&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;a class=&#34;heading-anchor&#34; href=&#34;#preparation&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none&#34;&gt;&#xA;            Preparation:&#xA;        &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;mix the flour and cocoa in a bowl&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;add the sugar and mix&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;beat the eggs and add&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;add the vanilla extract&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://nestordemeure.github.io/cooking/technique/melting_butter/&#34;&gt;melt the butter&lt;/a&gt;, add it and mix&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;pour in a pan lined with parchment paper&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;heading-wrapper&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;h2 id=&#34;cooking&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;a class=&#34;heading-anchor&#34; href=&#34;#cooking&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none&#34;&gt;&#xA;            Cooking:&#xA;        &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;cook 25 to 30 minutes in a 340F (170C) oven&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;let cool in the pan&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;cut into slices before serving (they might be best served the next day for peak flavor and texture)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;heading-wrapper&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;h2 id=&#34;credits&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;a class=&#34;heading-anchor&#34; href=&#34;#credits&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none&#34;&gt;&#xA;            Credits:&#xA;        &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is my take on Sarah Beeny&amp;rsquo;s chocolate brownies recipe (with which &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/usfNJCHCVLw&#34;&gt;she beat Gordon Ramsay on British television&lt;/a&gt;).&#xA;I mostly reduced the sugar levels and defaulted to salted butter (which makes everything better).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the annotated edition of &lt;a href=&#34;https://nestordemeure.github.io/writing/fiction/eldritch_academia/&#34;&gt;Eldritch Academia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;. I expect it to be of very limited interest to others (the short story is probably not worth an annotated edition) but, it is a fun way to record some of the thoughts and references I put in the text and an exercise in overloading a page with sidenotes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;My overall feeling about the story is that it lacks conflict, probably because the narrator is not resisting. Plus, it reaches its end very quickly, maybe too fast to let the reader understand that a transformation is happening.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This breakfast manages to both be delicious and give you the feeling that you are eating healthy. And it feels good.&#xA;I get the needed ingredients about once a month to eat it for a few days (I feel that eating it every day would reduce my enjoyment).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;heading-wrapper&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;h2 id=&#34;ingredients-1-bowl&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;a class=&#34;heading-anchor&#34; href=&#34;#ingredients-1-bowl&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none&#34;&gt;&#xA;            Ingredients (1 bowl):&#xA;        &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;two tablespoons of granola&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;two tablespoons of unsweetened coconut milk yogurt&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;two tablespoons of blueberries&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;a few strawberries&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;heading-wrapper&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;h2 id=&#34;preparation&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;a class=&#34;heading-anchor&#34; href=&#34;#preparation&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none&#34;&gt;&#xA;            Preparation:&#xA;        &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;put the granola in a bowl&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;add the yogurt&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;wash and add the blueberries&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;wash, dice and add the stawberries&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;heading-wrapper&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;h2 id=&#34;credits&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;a class=&#34;heading-anchor&#34; href=&#34;#credits&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none&#34;&gt;&#xA;            Credits:&#xA;        &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can find similar recipes on Internet.&#xA;This one was mostly shaped by the ingredients at my disposal.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This dish is slightly fancier than my usual weekday dish but it is good enough to have spoiled a lot of restaurant Carbonara pasta for me while being relatively fast and easy to cook.&#xA;Plus, it is vegetarian!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;heading-wrapper&#34;&gt;&#xA;

   &lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;once the pasta is cooked, add a splash of pasta water to the wok, this will help with the sauce consistency (you can be approximate with the quantity, too little and your sauce will miss a bit of thickness, too much and you will have to reduce longer: either way the result will be fine and you can do better next time) you can do it directly from the pasta pan, no need for an intermediate container (that would give you additional opportunities to burn yourself)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;strain the pasta and add them to the wok (it is okay if there is some pasta water left with the pasta, we have pasta water in the wok anyway)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;set the heat to low&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;add the sauce and mix constantly (to avoid having the egg yolk curl) until you reach the desired consistency (I recommend aiming for slightly more liquid than your sweet spot, the sauce will thicken further once served)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;serve on a plate&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34;

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;One day a famous government officer met a highly respected elderly master. Being conceited, he wanted to prove that he was the superior person.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As their conversation drew on, he asked the master, &amp;ldquo;Old monk, do you know what I think of you and the things you said?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The master replied, &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t care what you think of me. You are entitled to have your own opinion.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The officer snorted, &amp;ldquo;Well, I will tell you what I think anyway. In my eyes, you are just like a pile of dry shit!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the perfect recipe to do when you have leftover egg whites. It is delicious and uses barely any ingredients (I always keep the proper chocolate in my pantry to do this recipe when I have egg whites).&#xA;Its only downside is that, once you have prepared everything, you need to &lt;em&gt;wait&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;heading-wrapper&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;h2 id=&#34;ingredients-1-portion&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;a class=&#34;heading-anchor&#34; href=&#34;#ingredients-1-portion&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none&#34;&gt;&#xA;            Ingredients (1 portion):&#xA;        &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;1 egg whites&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;35 grams of chocolate&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;heading-wrapper&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;h2 id=&#34;preparation&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;a class=&#34;heading-anchor&#34; href=&#34;#preparation&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none&#34;&gt;&#xA;            Preparation:&#xA;        &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;beat your egg whites into a nice firm foam&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://nestordemeure.github.io/cooking/technique/melting_chocolate/&#34;&gt;melt the chocolate&lt;/a&gt; (it is okay to leave some chunks in the melted chocolate, they will add heterogeneity to the result)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;optionally, if you have egg yolks, add them to the melted chocolate and mix until homogeneous (be careful not to cook them in the hot chocolate)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;fold (&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/HsMzE2MwN8o&#34;&gt;or beat&lt;/a&gt;) the melted chocolate into the egg whites&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;pour into one glass, mug, or bowl per portion&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;store in the fridge for &lt;em&gt;at least 5 hours&lt;/em&gt; (you can wait a full night if you want to be sure)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;eat cold (you can shave some chocolate on top if you want to make it look fancy)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;heading-wrapper&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;h2 id=&#34;credits&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;a class=&#34;heading-anchor&#34; href=&#34;#credits&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none&#34;&gt;&#xA;            Credits:&#xA;        &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proportions are inspired by this &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.marmiton.org/recettes/recette_mousse-au-chocolat-facile_13585.aspx&#34;&gt;Mousse au chocolat facile&lt;/a&gt; recipe.&#xA;My main contribution is to experiment with the recipe to see how far I could simplify it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The cheapest kind of can opener you can buy in France is a single piece of metal with a sharp edge. It is also the most practical kind of can opener. In the US, it is called a Japanese can opener, and it is apparently &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.epicurious.com/shopping/this-japanese-can-opener-is-my-favorite-cutting-edge-kitchen-tool-article&#34;&gt;very fancy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Those things are a marvel of design. They have no moving parts (it is literally a single piece of metal), making them dead easy to use and clean, very durable (they will outlive you by a long shot), space-efficient (nice if, for whatever reason, you want to travel with your can opener), and dirt cheap (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Japanese-Can-Opener-Ganji-Kankiri/dp/B001TV6A7G&#34;&gt;about $9 on Amazon for a fancier model&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you do your groceries on foot, a shopping trolley bag (with wheels) is a game-changer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The main hurdle when going grocery shopping on foot is dealing with the weight of the produces on the way back.&#xA;However, I observed a large number of old people doing their groceries on foot as if it were nothing (while the way back was clearly strenuous to my weak arms).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Their superpower? The power of the &lt;em&gt;wheel&lt;/em&gt;!&#xA;If you put your produces in a trolley bag, you can carry the heaviest objects (I am talking yogurts, bottles of olive oil, and packs of milk all at the same time) as if they were nothing!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

   &lt;h2 id=&#34;ingredients-for-two-portions&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;a class=&#34;heading-anchor&#34; href=&#34;#ingredients-for-two-portions&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none&#34;&gt;&#xA;            Ingredients (for two portions):&#xA;        &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;160 grams of pasta (80 grams per person, you could go up to 100 grams), I like fusilli for this dish but most pasta types would be fine&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;1 bell pepper (all colors are fine, but I have a slight preference for red as it imparts some color to the pasta)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;some salted soy sauce (the salt will be useful)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;some olive oil (we will cook it so no need for high-quality stuff)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;some &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbes_de_Provence&#34;&gt;herbes de Provence&lt;/a&gt; (you could use another dry herbs mix but do use dry herbs, they make the flavor of the dish)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;some cayenne pepper (optional)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;heading-wrapper&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;h2 id=&#34;preparation&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;a class=&#34;heading-anchor&#34; href=&#34;#preparation&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none&#34;&gt;&#xA;            Preparation:&#xA;        &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;

count as boiling, you will be delighted to discover that I met people for which this is not obvious)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;add the pasta when the water starts boiling and keep cooking for about 10 minutes (until your pasta is cooked)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;heading-wrapper&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;h4 id=&#34;sauce&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;a class=&#34;heading-anchor&#34; href=&#34;#sauce&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none&#34;&gt;&#xA;            Sauce&#xA;        &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;once the pasta is in the water, put the diced bell pepper in a wok (or similar large pan) on low heat&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;add a generous splash of olive oil&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;add a generous splash of soy sauce (this will bring you the salt in the dish plus a lot of the flavor)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;add a very generous sprinkle of herbs (you can hardly overdo it here)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;optionally, add a sprinkle of cayenne pepper (you want enough for people to realize the dish has some hotness but no more, it is not a hot dish)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;cook on low heat&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;heading-wrapper&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;h4 id=&#34;assembly&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;a class=&#34;heading-anchor&#34; href=&#34;#assembly&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none&#34;&gt;&#xA;            Assembly&#xA;        &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;once the pasta is cooked, add a splash of pasta water to the wok, this will help with the sauce consistency (you can be approximate with the quantity, too little and your sauce will miss a bit of thickness, too much and you will have to reduce longer: either way the result will be fine and you can do better next time) you can do it directly from the pasta pan, no need for an intermediate container (that would give you additional opportunities to burn yourself)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;strain the pasta and add them to the wok (it is okay if there is some pasta water left with the pasta, we have pasta water in the wok anyway)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;raise to medium heat and keep mixing until you get the sauce consistency you want (the mixing time will depend on the amount of water you put, you should be done in two minutes)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;serve on a plate, feel free to add butter and shredded Parmesan to pimp the result slightly&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;heading-wrapper&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;h2 id=&#34;credits&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;a class=&#34;heading-anchor&#34; href=&#34;#credits&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none&#34;&gt;&#xA;            Credits:&#xA;        &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using the pasta water comes from &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/Ng7GWl57nQM&#34;&gt;French guy cooking&amp;rsquo;s Alex&lt;/a&gt; and is a game-changer for pasta sauces.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Philips Sonicare toothbrush is the best electronic toothbrush I ever used. By a significant margin.&#xA;It is not only good at cleaning your teeth but also one of those rare objects that are well &lt;em&gt;designed&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Regarding the quality of the cleaning (arguably the most important criteria), I could feel a sensible reduction in plaque when I went from a traditional toothbrush to an electric toothbrush, but this was one more step.&#xA;After brushing with an electric toothbrush, I used to be able to feel that there was some plaque left but switching to a Philips Sonicare &lt;em&gt;fully eliminated that sensation&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I just finished reading &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6479198-the-alchemaster-s-apprentice&#34;&gt;The Alchemaster&amp;rsquo;s Apprentice by Walter Moers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Superficially, the book is about a young crat&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; dying of hunger in the streets until he makes a Faustian bargain with an alchemaster: for a month he will be fed the best food, taught alchemy, and enjoy the best life a crat might want then, at the full moon, he will be &lt;em&gt;killed&lt;/em&gt; and rendered for his fat.&#xA;The book talks about friendship and love from a wide variety of angles, however, none of this is the point of the book, it is barely the seasoning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The easy path</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The opposite of wanting something to be perfect is following &lt;strong&gt;the easy path&lt;/strong&gt;: knowing that some things could be done to make your project objectively better but keeping the current version because it is &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;good enough&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This, &lt;em&gt;as long as the modification would be within the scope and allotted time&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, is a form of laziness.&#xA;However, it is insidious. All parts of a project have to be considered &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;good enough&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; before you let go of them to tackle the next step, it is very easy to not realize that your motivation shifted from an objective look at the quality of your work toward avoiding additional work to the detriment of the result.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The classical technique to melt chocolate is to use a &lt;em&gt;double broiler&lt;/em&gt; (also called bain Marie).&#xA;However, I am deeply convinced that using a microwave is significantly easier and faster.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;heading-wrapper&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;h2 id=&#34;ingredients&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;a class=&#34;heading-anchor&#34; href=&#34;#ingredients&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none&#34;&gt;&#xA;            Ingredients:&#xA;        &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;chocolate to melt&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;a tablespoon of water (you need some water to prevent dry burning but too much will deteriorate the result)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;if the recipe calls for melted butter, adding cream or milk, you can replace the water with one of those in the quantities required by the recipe&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;heading-wrapper&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;h2 id=&#34;technique&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;a class=&#34;heading-anchor&#34; href=&#34;#technique&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none&#34;&gt;&#xA;            Technique:&#xA;        &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;put the chocolate in a small bowl&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;add the liquid or milk produce&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;microwave until the chocolate is softened (around one minute depending on the strength of your microwave)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;mix the result to finish melting the chocolate&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;heading-wrapper&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;h2 id=&#34;credits&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;a class=&#34;heading-anchor&#34; href=&#34;#credits&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none&#34;&gt;&#xA;            Credits:&#xA;        &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am not aware of any particular credit for this technique, I saw it used by a variety of sources.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This pie dough is easy to make and tastes pretty much perfect for a US-style pie (with crust below and above the pie).&#xA;Plus, the leftover dough can be stored in the fridge for later use.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;heading-wrapper&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;h2 id=&#34;ingredients-for-one-pie&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;a class=&#34;heading-anchor&#34; href=&#34;#ingredients-for-one-pie&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none&#34;&gt;&#xA;            Ingredients (for one pie):&#xA;        &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;300 grams of flour&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;20 grams of sugar (optional)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;227 grams of salted butter (get it out of the fridge as soon as you start to raise its temperature and make your job easier)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;53 grams of water&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;8 grams of apple cider vinegar (&lt;em&gt;needs testing to see how impactful it is&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;heading-wrapper&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;h2 id=&#34;preparation&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;a class=&#34;heading-anchor&#34; href=&#34;#preparation&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none&#34;&gt;&#xA;            Preparation:&#xA;        &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;put the flour in a large bowl&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;add the sugar&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;add the butter diced or sliced into thin slices (to simplify the mixing)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;with one hand mix the dough until you get a crumbly/flaky consistency&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;add half of the water plus the vinegar and mix&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;add the leftover water and mix into a ball&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;cut the ball in two and refrigerate for 30 minutes while you prepare the fillings&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;heading-wrapper&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;h2 id=&#34;cooking&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;a class=&#34;heading-anchor&#34; href=&#34;#cooking&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none&#34;&gt;&#xA;            Cooking:&#xA;        &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You might want to prebake the bottom of our pie (for a European-style pie) or let your pie cook for a long time.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;once the pie is assembled, you can brush the top with some milk (to get a slight shine after cooking) and sprinkle a generous amount of sugar&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;heading-wrapper&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;h2 id=&#34;credits&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;a class=&#34;heading-anchor&#34; href=&#34;#credits&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none&#34;&gt;&#xA;            Credits:&#xA;        &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;All the credit goes to Chef John&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/e_3lBUMCRiA&#34;&gt;easy homemade pie crust&lt;/a&gt;.&#xA;I barely added sugar, used salted butter, and translated the measurements to grams.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;A magician is an actor playing the part of a magician.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&#xA;— Jean Eugène Robert-Houdin.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;heading-wrapper&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;h2 id=&#34;the-quote&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;a class=&#34;heading-anchor&#34; href=&#34;#the-quote&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none&#34;&gt;&#xA;            The quote&#xA;        &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This essay is dedicated to magicians.&#xA;Others might find it intriguing, but it will probably be irrelevant to them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you ask a magician to give you one famous quote about their object of study, the vast majority of them will tell you that Jean Eugène Robert-Houdin once said &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;A magician is an actor playing the part of a magician.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; (some might attribute it to Houdini, magicians are not all good with names and history&amp;hellip;).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/strong&gt;: This guide is mostly about me keeping a trace of the process I followed to create this blog.&#xA;I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; wanted to use GitHub for the hosting and that leads to a lot of additional complexity that you should avoid if you are not used to writing code.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;heading-wrapper&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;h2 id=&#34;hosting&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;a class=&#34;heading-anchor&#34; href=&#34;#hosting&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none&#34;&gt;&#xA;            Hosting&#xA;        &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I used &lt;a href=&#34;https://pages.github.com/&#34;&gt;GitHub pages&lt;/a&gt; to host my blog, they are free but only support static websites and, by default, force you to use their domain.&#xA;Both restrictions are fine by me since I wanted a static website and am okay with having a domain that makes it clear that writing code is a part of my life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tackling a large project (this applies to anything including a book, a piece of software, or a movie for example) can be daunting.&#xA;Suddenly it is not a sprint to the end of a task but, rather, an endurance race that requires regularly renewed dedication: something school and early life do not prepare you for.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These are my solutions to tackle large projects (you will find some overlap with my &lt;a href=&#34;https://nestordemeure.github.io/writing/guides/heuristics/&#34;&gt;guide to doing the things you love well&lt;/a&gt; and my &lt;a href=&#34;https://nestordemeure.github.io/writing/guides/writing/&#34;&gt;guide to writing&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Pasta ratatouille</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This dish is a worker: it is fast and easy to cook while being delicious and rich in vegetables and flavors.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have been cooking variations of this dish for as long as I have been cooking for myself, starting when I had my first apartment.&#xA;It has evolved a lot since its inception but it is still one of my favorite way to eat pasta.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;heading-wrapper&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;h2 id=&#34;ingredients-for-two-portions&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;a class=&#34;heading-anchor&#34; href=&#34;#ingredients-for-two-portions&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none&#34;&gt;&#xA;            Ingredients (for two portions):&#xA;        &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;160 grams of pasta (80 grams per person, you could go up to 100 grams), I like fusilli for this dish but most pasta types would be fine&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;half a jar of organic&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.auchan.fr/auchan-bio-ratatouille-en-bocal/pr-C1225159&#34;&gt;ratatouille&lt;/a&gt; (this is where I lose my US readers, you simply cannot find this stuff in the US: you might replace it with a jar of tomato sauce that contains a generous amount of eggplants and assorted vegetables)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;some salted soy sauce (the salt will be useful)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;some olive oil (we will cook it so no need for high-quality stuff)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;some salt (optional)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;some cayenne pepper (optional)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;heading-wrapper&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;h2 id=&#34;preparation&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;a class=&#34;heading-anchor&#34; href=&#34;#preparation&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none&#34;&gt;&#xA;            Preparation:&#xA;        &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;

           Pasta&#xA;        &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;fill a pan with water and bring it to a boil (big bubbles, small bubbles do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; count as boiling, you will be delighted to discover that I met people for which this is not obvious)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;you can optionally add a generous amount of salt to your pasta water, the pasta will taste better but, you do not need it here&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;add the pasta when the water starts boiling and keep cooking for about 10 minutes (until your pasta is cooked)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;heading-wrapper&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;h4 id=&#34;sauce&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;a class=&#34;heading-anchor&#34; href=&#34;#sauce&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none&#34;&gt;&#xA;            Sauce&#xA;        &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;once the pasta is in the water, put the ratatouille in a wok (or similar large pan) on low heat&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;add a generous splash of olive oil&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;add a generous splash of soy sauce (this will bring you the salt in the dish plus a lot of the flavor)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;optionally, add a sprinkle of cayenne pepper (you want enough for people to realize the dish has some hotness but no more, it is not a hot dish)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;cook on low heat&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;heading-wrapper&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;h4 id=&#34;assembly&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;a class=&#34;heading-anchor&#34; href=&#34;#assembly&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none&#34;&gt;&#xA;            Assembly&#xA;        &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;once the pasta is cooked, add a splash of pasta water to the wok, this will help with the sauce consistency (you can be approximate with the quantity, too little and your sauce will miss a bit of thickness, too much and you will have to reduce longer: either way the result will be fine and you can do better next time) you can do it directly from the pasta pan, no need for an intermediate container (that would give you additional opportunities to burn yourself)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;strain the pasta and add them to the wok (it is okay if there is some pasta water left with the pasta, we have pasta water in the wok anyway)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;raise to medium heat and keep mixing until you get the sauce consistency you want (the mixing time will depend on the amount of water you put, you should be done in two minutes)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;serve on a plate, feel free to add butter and shredded Parmesan to pimp the result slightly&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;heading-wrapper&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;h2 id=&#34;credits&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;a class=&#34;heading-anchor&#34; href=&#34;#credits&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none&#34;&gt;&#xA;            Credits:&#xA;        &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I used soy sauce and a jar of ratatouille because my father put them in my very first grocery bag as an independent student.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Avocado toast is the most shamefully Californian dish.&#xA;This version has a nice spicy punch to it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;heading-wrapper&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;h2 id=&#34;ingredients-one-toast&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;a class=&#34;heading-anchor&#34; href=&#34;#ingredients-one-toast&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none&#34;&gt;&#xA;            Ingredients (one toast):&#xA;        &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;one slice of bread (I recommend multigrain bread, it has more depth of flavor once toasted)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;some mayonnaise&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;one avocado&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;coarse salt&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;pepper&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Sriracha sauce (as this is a big part of the final flavor, do not accept substitutes to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.huyfong.com/&#34;&gt;the original sauce&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;heading-wrapper&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;h2 id=&#34;preparation&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;a class=&#34;heading-anchor&#34; href=&#34;#preparation&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none&#34;&gt;&#xA;            Preparation:&#xA;        &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;toast the bread&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;put a thin layer of mayonnaise on the bread&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;put a layer of avocado on the bread (you can spread it or slice it for a better-looking result)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;add a zigzag of Sriracha sauce&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;add a generous amount of salt and pepper&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;heading-wrapper&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;h2 id=&#34;credits&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;a class=&#34;heading-anchor&#34; href=&#34;#credits&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none&#34;&gt;&#xA;            Credits:&#xA;        &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This recipe is taken straight from &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/li-pPc6KNho&#34;&gt;You suck at cooking&amp;rsquo;s great Youtube Channel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the pinnacle of self-indulging food.&#xA;It is fast to prepare and very calorie-rich but the bacon, melted cheese, and toasted bread mesh perfectly and hit all the right spots.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;heading-wrapper&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;h2 id=&#34;ingredients-one-toast&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;a class=&#34;heading-anchor&#34; href=&#34;#ingredients-one-toast&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none&#34;&gt;&#xA;            Ingredients (one toast):&#xA;        &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;one or two slices of bacon&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;one slice of bread (I recommend multigrain bread, it has more depth of flavor once toasted)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;some mayonnaise&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;half a tomato&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;coarse salt (optional)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;shredded cheese&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;heading-wrapper&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;h2 id=&#34;preparation&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;a class=&#34;heading-anchor&#34; href=&#34;#preparation&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none&#34;&gt;&#xA;            Preparation:&#xA;        &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;cook the bacon until crisp&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;toast the bread&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;spread a thin layer of mayonnaise on the bread (it is there for some flavor notes but also to avoid having the tomato juice make the bread soggy)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;covers the bread with a one-slice thick layer of tomato&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;sprinkle some salt&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;add a layer of crispy bacon&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;add a pile of shredded cheese &lt;em&gt;at the very least as thick as the rest of the sandwich&lt;/em&gt; on top&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;toast until the cheese is melted to your preference&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;serve warm&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;heading-wrapper&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;h2 id=&#34;credits&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;a class=&#34;heading-anchor&#34; href=&#34;#credits&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none&#34;&gt;&#xA;            Credits:&#xA;        &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This recipe is taken straight from &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/bh4JyH29M2s&#34;&gt;You suck at cooking&amp;rsquo;s great Youtube Channel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Clafoutis</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Clafoutis was my favorite kind of cake when I was a kid. My mother used to make plum ones while fruits were in season and I famously ate a full cake that just got out of the oven while she was away from the kitchen.&#xA;They are also a great way to turn fruits into a cake that looks very pretty while being extremely easy to make.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;heading-wrapper&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;h2 id=&#34;ingredients&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;a class=&#34;heading-anchor&#34; href=&#34;#ingredients&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none&#34;&gt;&#xA;            Ingredients:&#xA;        &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;about 500grams (you want to cover your pan with a nice layer) of a mix of cherries and apricots (stones fruits such as cherries, plums apricots, and peaches feel like a better match but it works with pretty much anything including bananas and rhubarb, I like a mix of cherries and apricots to vary colors and flavors)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;4 eggs&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;100 grams of flour&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;60 grams of salted butter (you could use 45 grams of olive oil and some salt, the taste and texture would slightly differ but that still makes for a good cake)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;60 grams of sugar (you could go up to 100 grams according to taste)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;25cl of milk&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;some vanilla extract (optional)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;heading-wrapper&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;h2 id=&#34;preparation&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;a class=&#34;heading-anchor&#34; href=&#34;#preparation&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none&#34;&gt;&#xA;            Preparation:&#xA;        &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;heading-wrapper&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;h4 id=&#34;the-pan&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;a class=&#34;heading-anchor&#34; href=&#34;#the-pan&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none&#34;&gt;&#xA;            The pan&#xA;        &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;put a generous amount of butter on the sides of your cake pan (you want a wider rather than tall pan)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;cut your fruits (stones fruits can be cut into two or four, don&amp;rsquo;t forget to remove the stone, you can leave the skin on) and spread them in the cake pan&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;heading-wrapper&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;h4 id=&#34;the-batter&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;a class=&#34;heading-anchor&#34; href=&#34;#the-batter&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none&#34;&gt;&#xA;            The batter&#xA;        &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;mix the eggs with the sugar until smooth&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;add the (optional) vanilla extract&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;add the flour while mixing&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;add the milk while mixing&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;melt the butter in a microwave (or oven but 30 seconds in a microwave is perfect) then add (if the butter is warm, mix it fast enough to not cook your egg)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;pour the batter into your cake pan (the batter will be more golden and liquid than usual cake batter, it is perfectly normal)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;heading-wrapper&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;h2 id=&#34;cooking&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;a class=&#34;heading-anchor&#34; href=&#34;#cooking&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none&#34;&gt;&#xA;            Cooking:&#xA;        &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;cook 30 to 45 minutes at 350F (180C), you can stop once the top is golden and the batter firm&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;serve at room temperature (it is also great cold after a few hours in the fridge)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;you can (optionally) dust the top with powdered white sugar just before serving if you are serving cold (this is purely esthetic)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;heading-wrapper&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;h2 id=&#34;credits&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;a class=&#34;heading-anchor&#34; href=&#34;#credits&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none&#34;&gt;&#xA;            Credits:&#xA;        &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This clafoutis batter is pretty classic and can be found all over the web.&#xA;The fruit selection is mine but probably not original.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This cheese pie recipe is a family secret.&#xA;It was passed down from my grandmother to my mother to me (my sister did not care for cooking at the time).&#xA;I am writing it so that it can be saved for future generations to enjoy (if you want to keep a secret, put it in writing).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;heading-wrapper&#34;&gt;&#xA;

   &lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cook at 180C (350F) for 30 to 45 minutes (the crust should be hardened and the cheese pretty melted).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Serve warm (while very fluffy, it gets heavier on the stomach cold)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;heading-wrapper&#34;&gt;&#xA;

   &lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This recipe was taught to me by my mother who inherited it from my grandmother (on my father&amp;rsquo;s side).&#xA;Her only modification was to reduce the amount of butter (from 500 grams, my grandmother knew that butter is good stuff and was not afraid of using it).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Crumbles are pretty much impossible to miss and a great way to turn fruits (most fruits are suitable; apples, pears, and peaches are classic) and butter into a good cake.&#xA;This one is pimped with chocolate chips, cinnamon, vanilla extract, and lemon juice. They are all worth it but, you can cut all of them if you want to keep things simple (or do not have them on hand).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;heading-wrapper&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;h2 id=&#34;ingredients-for-4-portions&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;a class=&#34;heading-anchor&#34; href=&#34;#ingredients-for-4-portions&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none&#34;&gt;&#xA;            Ingredients (for 4 portions):&#xA;        &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;100g of flour (you can easily turn the grams into cups and half cups: it is the respective proportions that matter)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;100g of salted butter (you can also use unsalted butter and had some salt, the result is identical, but do not omit the salt)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;50g of sugar&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;2 large pears&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;some good cooking chocolate (no need for a sweet one, 70% cacao does a good job, also I like to get a chocolate bar and cut it into smallish chips, you get better quality chocolate and bigger chips)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;some cinnamon&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;some vanilla extract&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;some lemon juice&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;heading-wrapper&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;h2 id=&#34;preparation&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;a class=&#34;heading-anchor&#34; href=&#34;#preparation&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none&#34;&gt;&#xA;            Preparation:&#xA;        &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;heading-wrapper&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;h4 id=&#34;bottom-layer&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;a class=&#34;heading-anchor&#34; href=&#34;#bottom-layer&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none&#34;&gt;&#xA;            bottom layer&#xA;        &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;peel the pears, dice them, and put them on the bottom of your baking dish (I use a Pyrex square one), you want enough pears to garnish the bottom of the dish with about one centimeter of pears&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;add some lemon juice on top, not much just a spoonful so that the pears are finely coated&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;cut your chocolate into chips and sprinkle them on top of the layer of pears (no need for much, it is not a chocolate cake!)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;heading-wrapper&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;h4 id=&#34;cake-layer&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;a class=&#34;heading-anchor&#34; href=&#34;#cake-layer&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none&#34;&gt;&#xA;            cake layer&#xA;        &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;mix the flour and sugar in a large bowl&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;add some cinnamon (enough for people to identify that there is something but not enough for them to guess it is cinnamon)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;add some vanilla extract (same recommendation as for the cinnamon)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;cut the butter into dices and add it (let it rest at room temperature while you are doing the fruit layer, to make it a bit softer and easier to mix)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;mix the ingredients with one hand (you want to grab them in your hand, squeeze and restart until you have the texture of crumbly sand with large chunks of cake but no unmixed butter, the butter will soften at the contact of your body temperature, do not overmix: it should not become a perfect single blob of batter)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;sprinkle chunks of batter on top of the fruit layer (if you have flour left in the bottom of the bowl, you can dump it on the cake, you want to cover all of it with an equal thickness of chunks of the batter), look at pictures of crumble to get a feel for the appearance and texture you are going for&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;heading-wrapper&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;h2 id=&#34;cooking&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;a class=&#34;heading-anchor&#34; href=&#34;#cooking&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none&#34;&gt;&#xA;            Cooking:&#xA;        &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;cook for about 25 minutes at 350F (or 180C) (cooking time will vary, you want it to be golden on top but don&amp;rsquo;t need more than that)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;let it get down to room temperature before serving (it is also great cold, after a night in the fridge, the next day)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;heading-wrapper&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;h2 id=&#34;credits&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;a class=&#34;heading-anchor&#34; href=&#34;#credits&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none&#34;&gt;&#xA;            Credits:&#xA;        &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not much, the basic crumble batter is a classic that you find all over the internet.&#xA;The additions are mine but they follow fairly standard practices.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Krautburger is my favorite homemade burger of the moment.&#xA;It is vegetarian (but not vegan due to the presence of mayonnaise and, harder to replace, cheese) and light while hitting all the flavors I want due to the melted cheese and toasted bun combined with the surprising freshness of the thick tomato slice hidden inside the burger.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;heading-wrapper&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;h2 id=&#34;ingredients-one-burger&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;a class=&#34;heading-anchor&#34; href=&#34;#ingredients-one-burger&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none&#34;&gt;&#xA;            Ingredients (one burger):&#xA;        &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;a burger bun (bread rather than brioche if possible)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;some mayonnaise&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;one tomato&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;enough sauerkraut to make a small patty out of it (pick one that is not too flavorful and whose flavor &lt;em&gt;you like&lt;/em&gt;, otherwise you might be disappointed by this burger&amp;hellip;)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;2 slices of cheese (you want a cheese that does not melt instantly, so no American cheese, I like pepper jack because of the added flavor from the chili flakes, I would probably sprinkle some chilly flakes on my sauerkraut if all I had was Gruyère)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;heading-wrapper&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;h2 id=&#34;preparation&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;a class=&#34;heading-anchor&#34; href=&#34;#preparation&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none&#34;&gt;&#xA;            Preparation:&#xA;        &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;toast the lower bun (this step is optional but will reduce sogginess)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;spread a layer of mayonnaise on each half-bun (the goal here is not to act on the taste but to stop water from going through and into the bun)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;put thick tomato slices on the bottom bun until it is fully covered (I like my slices about one centimeter thick)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;add one slice of cheese&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;put some sauerkraut on top and shape it like a small pattie&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;add the second slice of cheese&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;add the final bun&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;heading-wrapper&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;h2 id=&#34;cooking&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;a class=&#34;heading-anchor&#34; href=&#34;#cooking&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none&#34;&gt;&#xA;            Cooking:&#xA;        &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;toast in the oven until the cheese is nicely melted and the top bun lightly toasted.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;heading-wrapper&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;h2 id=&#34;credits&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;a class=&#34;heading-anchor&#34; href=&#34;#credits&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none&#34;&gt;&#xA;            Credits:&#xA;        &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This burger was born from some experimentation with leftovers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I saw &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Batman_%28film%29&#34;&gt;the Batman&lt;/a&gt; and&amp;hellip; meh.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I love the acting of the Riddler in his unmasked sections (he looks like an accountant and that is great).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some solid action scenes, but none of the set pieces really strikes me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The gadgets are really nice (lenses, parachute, etc.) but the scenario leaves me cold.&#xA;The Riddler and the plot are clearly inspired by &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_%281995_film%29&#34;&gt;Seven&lt;/a&gt; while Batman&amp;rsquo;s moral (and notebook) are clearly taken from &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rorschach_%28character%29&#34;&gt;Watchmen&amp;rsquo;s Rorschach&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I watched &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/Q81Yf46Oj3s&#34;&gt;Guillermo Del Toro&amp;rsquo;s Nightmare Alley&lt;/a&gt; yesterday and&amp;hellip; It was ok.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I might have been let down a little because I love both Guillermo Del Toro and the source material (by the way, you can find both the original &lt;a href=&#34;https://archive.org/details/nightmarealley1947&#34;&gt;black&amp;amp;white movie&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://archive.org/details/nightmarealley00will/mode/2up&#34;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; for free, legally, on the internet archive) so I had a lot of expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The actors are solid, the movie has a very nice forties ambiance (I love the psychologist&amp;rsquo;s office design) and some scenes are wonderful (the one scene dealing with the consequence of his actions&amp;hellip; and the final scene which was already one of the strong points from the original story) but I felt that the scenario was lacking. In particular, it gets very &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; linear and unsurprising once they get out of the carnival (also, I believe all the parts on the main character&amp;rsquo;s father could have been omitted, I suspect it hinders more than it adds to the story).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here are some heuristics I use in life and work:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Play to your strengths; being balanced sounds nice but ends up being really unproductive/unpleasant.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Spend time on the things you like, as time and practice pile up you will end up skilled in those domains.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Go for the things that are of interest to you, not for the trendy ones.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Time spent automating tasks is usually time well spent.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Taking a break to gather knowledge on something vaguely connected to the thing you are doing is never time lost.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;When you have been procrastinating something for most of the day, declare that you will not do it today and that it is okay; it will free your mind to do other things instead of leaving you stuck.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Try and do one, single and quantifiable, thing a day. With time, they pile up, and you end up doing a lot of things.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The mind is good at criticizing something but bad at doing something from scratch: instead of trying to produce perfection, do a rough draft and then improve on it incrementally.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Also, be nice, kind, and nonjudgmental to people.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

It usually stems from them thinking that creativity is an innate gift: some people are born with a brain that overflows with ideas at regular intervals, while others stay dry for most of their life.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In practice, I have found creativity to be a &lt;em&gt;muscle&lt;/em&gt;. The more you try to use it, the easier it gets. But it doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily mean that you get good ideas&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

If not, don&amp;rsquo;t dwell on the negative. Instead, take this opportunity to think about what you really want out of your love life, and consider what you can do to make it happen &amp;ndash; and bring this unlucky streak to an end!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Don&amp;rsquo;t let it go to your head, but do go ahead and reward yourself &amp;ndash; sensibly! &amp;ndash; for your success. After all, there&amp;rsquo;s no point in earning it if you can&amp;rsquo;t enjoy it a little.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

While keeping your eyes peeled will naturally help you dodge a few of them, you&amp;rsquo;re bound to hit some of them head on. While this is sure to be frustrating, remember it&amp;rsquo;s up to you to change your circumstances if things aren&amp;rsquo;t going the way you know you deserve.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

So don&amp;rsquo;t be shy! Whenever you take charge of the situation and grab the reins, you&amp;rsquo;re sure to see some of those dreams transform into magnificent real life events.

Projects that you&amp;rsquo;ve had in the works will finally start to show results, and you&amp;rsquo;ll find yourself solidly in the black (maybe even with a little left over to spare). Stay cautious, and keep working to insure your good fortune doesn&amp;rsquo;t turn out to be a fluke.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

How you take advantage of that is up to you, but be sure to make the most of it. You feel like you deserve a little loving care in your life, and you know what? You&amp;rsquo;re right! So enjoy it for all it&amp;rsquo;s worth.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;This side of the movement in the scholarship has, however, been slow because doing it well requires a lot of language expertise: not just Greek and Latin, but perhaps also Babylonian, Old Persian and Egyptian. Not a lot of scholars have that kind of language expertise, both because it’s hard to learn that many languages, but also because it is hard to learn those eastern languages at all because they’re simply not taught in many universities. Indeed, the number shrinks over time, as language programs are often under siege at universities.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&#xA;&amp;mdash; Bret Devereaux, &lt;a href=&#34;https://acoup.blog/2024/05/17/collections-on-the-reign-of-alexander-iii-of-macedon-the-great/#:~:text=This%20side%20of,siege%20at%20universities&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;On the Reign of Alexander III of Macedon, the Great?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am an engineer with a specialty in applied mathematics and computer science.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can find most of the software I developed on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/nestordemeure&#34;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/nestordemeure&#34;&gt;Gitlab&lt;/a&gt;. Here is a list of some noticeable libraries (focusing on projects where I am the lead developer):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;heading-wrapper&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;h4 id=&#34;divinatory-gpts-prompt&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;a class=&#34;heading-anchor&#34; href=&#34;#divinatory-gpts-prompt&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none&#34;&gt;&#xA;            &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/nestordemeure/DivinatoryGPTs&#34;&gt;Divinatory GPTs&lt;/a&gt; (Prompt)&#xA;        &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a collection of scripts and prompts I used to make &lt;a href=&#34;https://openai.com/blog/introducing-gpts&#34;&gt;custom GPTs&lt;/a&gt; around the theme of divination (and, in particular, tools to help people become better tarot readers).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
