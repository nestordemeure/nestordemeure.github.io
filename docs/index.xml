      <description>I just finished reading The Alchemaster&amp;rsquo;s Apprentice by Walter Moers.
Superficially, the book is about a young crat1 dying of hunger in the streets until he makes a Faustian bargain with an alchemaster: for a month he will be feed the best food, taught alchemy and enjoy the best life a crat might want then, at the full moon, he will be killed and rendered for his fat. The book talks about friendship and love from a wide variety of angles, however, none of this is he point of the book, it is barely the seasoning.</description>

      <description>I finished The Birthday of the World and Other Stories by Ursula K. Le Guin a few months ago. I know of Ursula Le Guin by reputation1, but it is the first of her book that I read and&amp;hellip; it was a slap on the face.
The book is a collection of short stories in her Ekumen universe making them technically science fiction. However, while science-fiction usually deals with things and technologies, these stories are all about people and feelings.</description>

      <description>Disclaimer: I have written non-fiction professionally in various fields by never published any fiction so take the following with the appropriate amount of salt. Also, a lot of this advice is shared with my guide to doing a large project. I highly recommend that you consult it.
Do a bad version first Stealing advice from Dan Harmon, write something bad.
The human mind is terrible at writing something perfect in one go but very good at criticizing things.</description>

      <description>Crêpes are the perfect social dish. You can make them together then everyone put the topping of their choice on top, sweet or savory1.
Ingredients (4 people):  250 grams flour 4 eggs 500 ml milk 50 salted butter (a pinch of salt and 40 grams of olive oil, the taste is slightly different but it works) 25 grams of sugar  Preparation:  put the flout in a mixing bowl add the sugar add the salt add the eggs and mix add the milk progressively while mixing add the melted butter (making sure it is not ht enough to cook the eggs prematurely) and mix  Cooking:  slightly oil (or butter) a pan put a ladle worth of crêpe batter and spread it to make it round once the bottom is cooked (the sides should start to get browned), use a spoon and flip it (it should cook for about a minute) repeat as many times as needed  Credits: This recipe is my version of Crêpes : la meilleure recette rapide.</description>

      <title>The easy path</title>

      <description>The opposite of wanting something to be perfect is following the easy path: knowing that some things could be done to make your project objectively better but keeping the current version because it is &amp;ldquo;good enough&amp;rdquo;.
This, as long as the modification would be within scope and allotted time1, is a form of laziness. However, it is insidious, all parts of a project have to be considered &amp;ldquo;good enough&amp;rdquo; before you let go of them to tackle the next step, it is very easy to not realize that your motivation shifted from an objective look at the quality of your work toward avoiding additional work to the detriment of the end result.</description>

      <title>Chef John&#39;s US pie crust</title>

      <guid>https://nestordemeure.github.io/cooking/sweet/us_pie_crust/</guid>
      <description>This pie dough is easy to make and taste pretty much perfect for a US style pie (with crust below and above the pie). Plus, leftover dough can be stored in the fridge for later use.
Ingredients (for one pie):  300 grams of flour 20 grams of sugar (optional) 227 grams of salted butter (get it out of the fridge as soon as you start to raise its temperature and make your job easier) 53 grams of water 8 grams of apple cider vinegar (needs testing to see how impactful it is)  Preparation:  put the flour in a large bowl add the sugar add the butter diced or sliced into thin slice (to simplify the mixing) with one hand mix the dough until you get a crumbly / flaky consistency add half of the water plus the vinegar and mix add the leftover water and mix into a ball cut the ball in two and refrigerate 30 minutes while you prepare the fillings  Cooking:  You might want to prebake the bottom of our pie (for a European style pie) or let you pie cook for a long time.</description>

      <description>This should be obvious but&amp;hellip;

      <description>The classical technique to melt chocolate is to use a double broiler (also called bain Marie). However, I am deeply convinced that using a microwave is significantly easier and faster.
Ingredients:  chocolate to melt a tablespoon of water (you need some water to prevent dry burning but too much will deteriorate the end result) if the recipe calls for melted butter, adding cream or milk, you can replace the water with one of those in the quantities required by the recipe  Technique:  put the chocolate in a small bowl add the liquid or milk produce microwave until the chocolate is softened (around one minute depending on the strength of your microwave) mix the result to finish melting the chocolate  Credits: I am not aware of any particular credit for this technique, I saw it in a variety of sources.</description>

 The quote This essay is dedicated to magicians. Others might find it intriguing, but it will probably be irrelevant to them.
If you ask a magician to give you one famous quote about their object of study, the vast majority of them will tell you that Jean Eugène Robert-Houdin once said &amp;ldquo;A magician is an actor playing the part of a magician.</description>

      <description>Disclaimer: this guide is mostly about me keeping a trace of the process I followed to create this blog. I really wanted to use GitHub for the hosting and that leads to a lot of additional complexity that you should avoid if you are not used to writing code.
Hosting I used GitHub pages to host my blog, they are free but only support static websites and, by default, force you to use their domain.</description>

      <title>Nestor&#39;s guide to doing a large project</title>
      <link>https://nestordemeure.github.io/writing/guides/hard_things/</link>

      <guid>https://nestordemeure.github.io/writing/guides/hard_things/</guid>
      <description>Tackling a large project (this applies to anything including a book, a piece of software or a movie for example) can be daunting. Suddenly it is not a sprint to the end of a task but, rather, an endurance race that requires regularly renewed dedication: something school and early life does not prepare you for.
These are my solutions to tackle large projects (you will find some overlap with my guide to doing the things you love well and my guide to writing).</description>

      <title>The everlasting pasta ratatouille</title>
      <link>https://nestordemeure.github.io/cooking/savoury/pasta_ratatouille/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 29 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://nestordemeure.github.io/cooking/savoury/pasta_ratatouille/</guid>
      <description>This dish is a worker: it is fast and easy to cook while being delicious and rich in vegetables and flavors.
I have been cooking variations of this dish for as long as I have been cooking for myself, starting when I had my first apartment. It has evolved a lot since its inception but it is still one of my favorite way to eat pasta.
Ingredients (for two portions):  160 grams of pasta (80 grams per person, you could go up to 100 grams), I like fusilli for this dish but most pasta types would be fine half a jar of organic1 ratatouille (this is where I lose my US readers, you simply cannot find this stuff in the US: you might replace it with a jar of tomato sauce that contains a generous amount of eggplants and assorted vegetables) some salted soy sauce (the salt will be useful) some olive oil (we will cook it so no need for high quality stuff) some salt (optional) some cayenne pepper (optional)  Preparation: Pasta  fill a pan with water and bring it to a boil (big bubbles, small bubbles do not count as boiling, you will be delighted to discover that I met people for which this is not obvious) you can optionally add a generous amount of salt to your pasta water, the pasta will taste better but do not need it here add the pasta when the water starts boiling and keep cooking for about 10 minutes (until your pasta are cooked)  Sauce  once the pasta are in the water, put the ratatouille in a wok (or similar large pan) on low heat add a generous splash of olive oil add a generous splash of soy sauce (this will bring you the salt in the dish plus a lot of the flavor) optionally, add a sprinkle of cayenne pepper (you want enough for people to realize the dish has some hotness but no more, it is not a hot dish) cook on low heat  Assembly  once the pasta are cooked, add a splash of pasta water in the wok, this will help with the sauce consistency (you can be approximate with the quantity, too little and your sauce will miss a bit of thickness, too much and you will have to reduce longer: either way the result will be fine and you can do better next time) you can do it directly from the pasta pan, no need for an intermediate container (that would give you additional opportunities to burn yourself) strain the pasta and add them to the wok (it is okay if there is some pasta water left with the pasta, we have pasta water in the wok anyway) raise to medium it and keep mixing until you get the sauce consistency you want (the mixing time will depend on the amount of water you put, you should be done in two minutes) serve in a plate, feel free to add butter and shredded Parmesan to pimp the result slightly  Credits: I used soy sauce and a jar of ratatouille because my father put them in my very first grocery bag as an independent student.</description>

      <title>The secret of the Tarte au Maroille</title>

      <description>This cheese pie recipe is a family secret. It was past down from my grandmother to my mother to me (my sister did not care for cooking at the time). I am writing it so that it can be saved for future generation to enjoy (if you want to keep a secret, put it in writing).
Ingredients (two pies): Dought  1 kg of white flour 5 egg yolks 1 cube of fresh yeast (if you cannot find it, it is hard to find in the US, a sachet of dry yeast will be fine but result in a more homogeneous result) a few spoonfuls of sugar (white is fine, brown is better, cassonade/vergeoise is traditional) 125 grams of salted butter (butter is good, salted is better)  Toping  one egg, one egg&amp;rsquo;s worth of milk, some grated nutmeg (optional) one big, full, Maroille (this is a washed rind cheese with a strong smell, slightly sticky texture and a pinkish color, typical from north France and very hard to replace in this recipe as most similar cheeses stay too strong once baked while Maroille&amp;rsquo;s taste mellow enough for even non cheese lovers to love this pie)  Preparation: Dough  Put the sugar and the yeast in a small bowl of warmish water (my rule of thumb is that it should feel warm, so above body temperature, but no more than that, if you can burn your finger then it will kill your yeast&amp;hellip; I should maybe invest in a thermometer), mix once and let rest until it gets foamy put most of the flour in a large mixing bowl (set a little aside to shape the dough later) add the egg yolks and the yeast with its water mix until combined, do not over mix (the resulting dough will be very sticky) cover with a towel and let rise for one hour (warmish places such as a window in the sun are best)  Assembling the pie  spread the dough on top of your pizza pans (you want flat pans rather than pie pans), you can use the leftover flour to help shape the dough (do not use a rolling pin, this is a finger stretching affair) add slices of Maroile on your pan (you want to cover it, the more the merrier) brush with a mix done with one egg and a little bit of milk (you can brush with your fingers) add a little bit of grounded nutmeg  Cooking:  Cook at 180C (350F) for 30 to 45 minutes (the crust should be hardened and the cheese pretty melted).</description>

      <title>The surprisingly-good-looking Clafoutis</title>
      <link>https://nestordemeure.github.io/cooking/sweet/clafoutis/</link>

      <guid>https://nestordemeure.github.io/cooking/sweet/clafoutis/</guid>
      <description>Clafoutis were my favorite kind of cake when I was a kid. My mother used to make plum ones while fruits were in season and I famously ate a full cake who just got out of the oven while she was away of the kitchen. They are also a great way to turn fruits into a cake that looks very pretty while being extremely easy to make.
Ingredients:  about 500grams (you want to cover your pan with a nice layer) of a mix of cherries and apricots (stones fruits such as cherries, plums apricots and peaches feel like a better match but it works with pretty much anything including bananas and rhubarb, I like a mix of cherries and apricots to vary colors and flavors) 4 eggs 100 grams of flour 60 grams of salted butter (you could use 45 grams of olive oil and some salt, the taste and texture would slightly differ but that still makes for a good cake) 60 grams of sugar (you could go up to 100 grams according to taste) 25cl of milk some vanilla extract (optional)  Preparation: The pan  put a generous amount of butter on the sides of your cake pan (you want a wider rather than tall pan) cut your fruits (stones fruits can be cut into two or four, don&amp;rsquo;t forget to remove the stone, you can leave the skin on) and spread them in the cake pan  The batter  mix the eggs with the sugar until smooth add the (optional) vanilla extract add the flour while mixing add the milk while mixing melt the butter in a microwave (or oven but 30 seconds in a microwave is perfect) then add (if the butter is warm, mix it fast enough to not cook your egg) pour the batter in your cake pan (the batter will be more golden and liquid than usual cake batter, it is perfectly normal)  Cooking:  cook 30 to 45 minutes at 350F (180C), you can stop once the top is golden and the batter firm serve at room temperature (it is also great cold after a few hours in the fridge) you can (optionally) dust the top with powdered white sugar just before serving if you are serving cold (this is purely esthetic)  Credits: This clafoutis batter is pretty classic and can be found all over the web.</description>

      <title>The mighty KrautBurger</title>

      <guid>https://nestordemeure.github.io/cooking/savoury/krautburger/</guid>
      <description>The Krautburger is my favorite homemade burger of the moment. It is vegetarian (but not vegan due to the presence of mayonnaise and, harder to replace, cheese) and light while hitting all the flavors I want due to the melted cheese and toasted bun combined with the surprise freshness of the thick tomato slice hidden inside the burger.
Ingredients (one burger):  a burger bun (bread rather than brioche if possible) some mayonnaise one tomato enough sauerkraut to make a small patty out of it (pick one that is not too flavorful and whose flavor you like, otherwise you might be disappointed by this burger&amp;hellip;) 2 slices of cheese (you want a cheese that does not melt instantly, so no American cheese, I like pepper jack because of the added flavor from the chili flakes, I would probably sprinkle some chilly flakes on my sauerkraut if all I had was Gruyère)  Preparation:  toast the lower bun (this step is optional but will reduce sogginess) spread a layer of mayonnaise on each half bun (the goal here is not to act on the taste but to stop water from going through and into the bun) put thick tomato slices on the bottom bun until it is fully covered (I like my slices about one centimeter thick) add one slice of cheese put some sauerkraut on top and shape it like a small pattie add the second slice of cheese add the final bun  Cooking:  toast in oven until the cheese is nicely melted and the top bun lightly toasted  Credits: This burger was born from some experimentation with leftovers.</description>

      <guid>https://nestordemeure.github.io/cooking/sweet/crumble/</guid>
      <description>Crumbles are basically impossible to miss and a great way to turn fruits (most fruits are suitable; apples, pears and peaches are classic) and butter into a good cake. This one is pimped with chocolate chips, cinnamon, vanilla extract and lemon juice. They are all worth it but, you can cut all of them if you want to keep things simple (or do not have them on hand).
Ingredients (for 4 portions):  100g of flour (you can easily turn the grams in cups and half cups: it is the respective proportions that matter) 100g of salted butter (you can also use unsalted butter and had some salt, the end result is identical, but do not omit the salt) 50g of sugar 2 large pears some good cooking chocolate (no need for a sweet one, 70% cacao does a good job, also I like to get a chocolate bar and cut it into smallish chips, you get better quality chocolate and bigger chips) some cinnamon some vanilla extract some lemon juice  Preparation: bottom layer  peel the pears, dice them and put them on the bottom of your baking dish (I use a Pyrex square one), you want enough pears to garnish the bottom of the dish with about one centimeter of pears add some lemon juice on top, not much just a spoonful so that the pear are finely coated cut your chocolate into chips and sprinkle them on top of the layer of pears (no need for much, it is not a chocolate cake!</description>

      <description>Note: this review is adapted from some text messages so it is written in a flow of consciousness type of way.
I saw the Batman and&amp;hellip; meh.
I love the acting of the Riddler in his unmasked sections (he looks like and accountant and that is great).
Some solid action scenes, but none of the set pieces really strikes me.
The gadgets are really nice (lenses, parachute, etc.) but the scenario leaves me cold.</description>

      <description>I watched Guillermo Del Toro&amp;rsquo;s Nightmare Alley yesterday and&amp;hellip; It was ok.
I might have been let down a little because I love both Guillermo Del Toro and the source material (by the way, you can find both the original black&amp;amp;white movie and the book for free, legally, on the internet archive) so I had a lot of expectations.
The actors are solid, the movie has a very nice forties ambiance (I love the psychologist&amp;rsquo;s office design) and some scenes are wonderful (the one scene dealing with the consequence of his actions&amp;hellip; and the final scene which was already one of the strong points from the original story) but I felt that the scenario was lacking.</description>

      <description>Here are some heuristics I use in life and work:
 Play to your strengths, being balanced sounds nice but end up being really unproductive / unpleasant. Spend time on the things you like, as time and practice pile up you will end up skilled in those domains. Go for the things that are of interest to you, not for the trendy ones. Time spend automating tasks is usually time well spent.</description>

How are you doing?
To answer your question (sorry for the late email, moving did not leave me much time to write), the math department is paying me to study KTu-L spaces.
You might have seen some reference to them popping up in the past year, they have gained a lot of visibility as some mathematicians (mostly Providence’s research team which I will be joining this week) claim that they can be used to solve a number of interesting conjectures.</description>

      <title>Nestor&#39;s guide to having ideas</title>

      <description>No one is born uncreative Some people have told me that they are not creative. It usually stems from them thinking that creativity is an innate gift: some people are born with a brain that overflow with ideas at regular intervals while others stay dry for most of their life.
In practice, I found creativity to be a muscle. The more you try to use it and the easier it gets.</description>

      <title>Consulting mentalist</title>

      <description>I am a consulting mentalist (I have a book published for that public and I designed a stage show amongst other things).
What is mentalism? Mentalism is an ensemble of techniques (including mnemotechnic, hypnosis, magic tricks, a knowledge of statistically likely phenomenons and a trained intuition) used to produce incredible phenomenons (usually psychic phenomenons or an impressive mastery of the human mind) in an entertainment setting.
One point that is worth stressing is that it is neither all real (magic tricks are great to make things look better / add some punch and anyone telling you they don&amp;rsquo;t use them is either lying or very ignorant) nor all fake (anyone telling you otherwise is, similarly, likely ignorant or a magician who did some telepathy-themed tricks and think that it is all there is to it, the human mind is an amazing toy).</description>

      <description>I am a researcher with specialties in numerical accuracy, artificial intelligence, data analysis and high performance computing.
Papers You can find most of my publications on Researchgate. Here is a list of them in no particular order:
Ranger21: a synergistic deep learning optimizer (machine learning) The Ranger21 paper was born from testing a large number of optimizers for deep learning and realizing that, while people where branding them as new optimizers, they often just included one new idea to an existing optimizer.</description>

      <description>STATUS: DRAFT
One good tip I got to rubber duck debug without another human was to write your questions / explanations in an email or a chat. I found that indeed, writing an email explaining a problem to a colleague was helpful to solve it despite me never sending the email.
It also applies to debugging the human mind.</description>

      <description>I am an engineer1 with a specialty in applied mathematics and computer science.
You can find most of the software I developed on Github and Gitlab. Here is a list of some noticeable libraries (focussing on projects where I am the main developer) in no particular order:
Shaman (C++) Shaman is the crown jewel of my PhD, it helps you track and measure the numerical error in a computation by replacing the types (double becomes Sdouble) with instrumented version.</description>
