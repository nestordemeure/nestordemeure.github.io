      <title>The mighty KrautBurger</title>

      <description>The Krautburger is my favourite homemade burger of the moment. It is vegetarian (but not vegan due to the presence of mayonaise and, harder to replace, cheese) and light while hitting all the flavours I want due to the melted cheese and toasted bun combined with the surprise freshness of the thick tomato slice hidden inside the burger.
Ingredients (one burger):  a burger bun (bread rather than brioche if possible) some mayonaise one tomato enough sauerkraut to make a small patty out of it (pick one that is not too flavorfull and whose flavor you like, otherwise you might be disapointed by this burger&amp;hellip;) 2 slices of cheese (you want a cheese that does not melt instantly, so no american cheese, I like pepper jack because of the added flavor from the chili flakes, I would probably spinkle some chilly flakes on my sauerkraut if all I had was Gruyere)  Preparation:  toast the lower bun (this step is optional but will reduce soginess) spread a layer of mayonnaise on each half bun (the goal here is not to act on the taste but to stop water from going through and into the bun) put thick tomato slices on the bottom bun until it is fully covered (I like my slices about one centimeter thick) add one slice of cheese put some sauerkraut on top and shape it like a small pattie add the second slice of cheese add the final bun  Cooking:  toast in oven until the cheese is nicely melted and the top bun lightly toasted  Credits: This burger was born from some experimentation with leftovers.</description>

      <title>The not-so-secret Crumble recipe</title>

      <description>Crumbles are basically impossible to miss and a great way to turn fruits (most fruits are suitable; apples, pears and peaches are classic) and butter into a good cake. This one is pimped with chocolate chips, cinamon, vanilla extract and lemon juice. They are all worth it but, you can cut all of them if you want to keep things simple (or do not have them on hand).
Ingredients (for 4 portions):  100g of flour (you can easily turn the grams in cups and half cups: it is the respective proportions that matter) 100g of salted butter (you can also use unsalted butter and had some salt, the end result is identical, but do not omit the salt) 50g of sugar 2 large pears some good cooking chocolate (no need for a sweet one, 70% cacao does a good job, also I like to get a chocolate bar and cut it into small-ish chips, you get better quality chocolate and bigger chips) some cinnamon some vanilla extract some lemon juice  Preparation: bottom layer  peel the pears, dice them and put them on the bottom of your baking dish (I use a pyrex square one), you want enough pears to garnish the bottom of the dish with about one centimeter of pears add some lemon juice on top, not much just a spoonful so that the pear are finely coated cut your chocolate into chips and sprinkle them on top of the layer of pears (no need for much, it is not a chocolate cake!</description>

      <title>The secret of the Tarte au Maroille</title>
      <link>https://nestordemeure.github.io/cooking/savoury/tarte-au-maroille/</link>

      <guid>https://nestordemeure.github.io/cooking/savoury/tarte-au-maroille/</guid>
      <description>This cheese pie recipe is a family secret. It was past down from my grandmother to my mother to me (my sister did not care for cooking at the time). I am writting it so that it can be saved for future generation to enjoy (if you want to keep a secret, put it in writting).
Ingredients (two pies): Dought  1kg of white flour 5 egg yolks 1 cube of fresh yeast (if you cannot find it, it is hard to find in the US, a paquet of dry yeast will be fine but result in a more homogeneous result) a few spoonful of suger (white is fine, brown is better, cassonade/vergeoise is traditional) 125 grams of salted butter (butter is good, salted is better)  Toping:  one egg one egg&amp;rsquo;s worth of milk some gratted nutmeg (optional) one big, full, Maroille (this is a washed rind cheese with a strong smell, slightly sticky texture and a pinkish color, typical from north France and very hard to replace in this recipe as most similar cheeses stay too strong once baked while Maroille&amp;rsquo;s taste mellow enough for even non cheese lovers to love this pie)  Preparation: Dough  put the sugar and the yeast in a sall bowl of warmish water (my rule of thumb is that it should feel warm, so above body temperature, but no more than that, if you can burn your finger then it will kill your yeast&amp;hellip; I should maybe invest in a thermometer), mix once and let rest until it gets foamy put most of the flour in a large mixing bowl (set a little aside to shape the dough later) add the egg yolks and the yeast with its water mix until combined, do not overmix (the resulting dough will be very sticky) cover with a towel and let rise for one hour (warmish places such as a window in the sun are best)  Assembling the pie  spread the dough on top of your pizza pans (you want flat pans rather than pie pans), you can use the leftover flour to help shape the dough (do not use a rollin pin, this is a finger streching affair) add slices of Maroile on your pan (you want to cover it, the more the merryier) brush with a mix done with one egg and a little bit of milk (you can brush with your fingers) add a little bit of grounded nutmeg  Cooking:  cook at 180C (350F) for 30 to 45 minutes (the crust should be hardened and the cheese pretty melted).</description>

      <title>The surprisingly-good-looking Clafoutis</title>
      <link>https://nestordemeure.github.io/cooking/sweet/clafoutis/</link>

      <description>Clafoutis where my favourite kind of cake when I was a kid. My mother used to make plum ones while fruits were in season and I famously ate a full cake who just got out of the oven while she was away of the kitchen. They are also a great way to turn fruits into a cake that looks very pretty while being extremely easy to make.
Ingredients:  about 500grams (you want to cover your pan with a nice layer) of a mix of cherries and apricots (stones fruits such as cherries, plums apricots and peaches feel like a better match but it work with pretty much anything including banannas and rhubard, I like a mix of cherries and apricots to vary colors and flavours) 4 eggs 100 grams of flour 60 grams of salted butter (you could use olive oil and some salt, the taste would differ but that still makes for a good cake) 100 grams of sugar (could be reduced according to taste) 25cl of milk some vanilla extract (optional)  Preparation: The pan  put a generous amount of butter on the sides of your cake pan (you want a wider rather than tall pan) cut your fruits (stones fruits can be cut into two or four, don&amp;rsquo;t forget to remove the stone, you can leave the skin on) and spread them in the cake pan  The batter  mix the eggs with the sugar until smooth add the (optional) vanilla extract add the flour while mixing add the milk while mixing melt the butter in a microwave (or oven but 30 seconds in a microwave is perfect) then add (if the butter is warm, mix it fast enough to not cook your egg) pour the batter in your cake pan (the batter will be more golden and liquid than usual cake batter, it is perfectly normal)  Cooking:  cook 30 to 45 minutes at 350F (180C), you can stop once the top is golden and the batter firm serve at room temperature (it is also great cold after a few hours in the fridge) you can (optionally) dust the top with powdered white sugar just before serving if you are serving cold (this is purely esthetic)  Credits This clafoutis batter is pretty classic and can be found all over the web.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;A magician is an actor playing the part of a magician.&amp;rdquo; — Jean Eugène Robert-Houdin.
 The quote This essay is dedicated to magicians. Others might find it intriguing, but it will probably be irrelevant to them.
If you ask a magician to give you one famous quote about their object of study, the vast majority of them will tell you that Jean Eugène Robert-Houdin once said &amp;ldquo;A magician is an actor playing the part of a magician.</description>

      <description>I am a consulting mentalist (I have a book published for that public and I designed a stage show amongst other things).
What is mentalism? Mentalism is an ensemble of techniques (including mnemotechnic, hypnosis, magic tricks, a knowledge of statistically likely phenomenons and a trained intuition) used to produce incredible phenomenons (usually psychic phenomenons or an impressive mastery of the human mind) in an entertainment setting.
One point that is worth stressing is that it is neither all real (magic tricks are great to make things look better / add some punch and anyone telling you they don&amp;rsquo;t use them is either lying or very ignorant) nor all fake (anyone telling you otherwise is, similarly, likely ignorant or a magician who did some telepathy-themed tricks and think that it is all there is to it, the human mind is an amazing toy).</description>

      <description>Object: Some News Hey Sonia,
How are you doing?
To answer your question (sorry for the late email, moving did not leave me much time to write), the math department is paying me to study KTu-L spaces.
You might have seen some reference to them popping up in the past year, they have gained a lot of visibility as some mathematicians (mostly Providence’s research team which I will be joining this week) claim that they can be used to solve a number of interesting conjectures.</description>

      <description>For me making a habit of thinking about problems, writing my ideas and organizing them has been extremely valuable in all fields where I applied it (I am a PhD student in computeur science and act as a consultant for some magicians). I do not think that you can make a habit of producing good ideas but if you produce enough ideas you will end up producing at least a few good ones, it is only a matter of time.</description>

There are a lot of men per woman on those apps so women there are used to doing very little work and having a lot of choices to select from.</description>

      <description>I watched Guillermo Del Toro&amp;rsquo;s Nightmare Alley yesterday and&amp;hellip; It was ok.
I might have been let down a little because I love both Guillermo Del Toro and the source material (by the way, you can find both the original black&amp;amp;white movie and the book for free, legally, on the internet archive) so I had a lot of expectations.
The actors are solid, the movie has a very nice forties ambiance (I love the psychologist&amp;rsquo;s office design) and some scene are wonderful (the one scene dealing with the consequence of his actions&amp;hellip; and the final scene which was already one of the strong points from the original story) but I felt that the scenario was lacking.</description>

      <description>One good tip I got to rubber duck debug without another human was to write your questions / explanations in an email or a chat. I found that indeed, writing an email explaining a problem to a colleague was helpful to solve it despite me never sending the email.
It also applies to debugging the human mind.</description>

      <description>Note: this review is adapted from some text messages so it is written in a flow of consciousness type of way.
I saw the Batman and&amp;hellip; meh.
I love the acting of the Riddler in his unmasked sections (he looks like and accountant and that is great).
Some solid action scenes but none of the set pieces really strikes me.
The gadgets are really nice (lenses, parachte, etc) but the scenario leaves me cold.</description>
