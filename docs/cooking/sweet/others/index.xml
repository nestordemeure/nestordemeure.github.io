      <description>Those cookies are very worth doing. They focus the flavor on the red bean paste while looking fancier than they are difficult to cook (which is always a good thing).
Ingredients (2 person):    1 egg 50 grams of salted butter 100 grams of flour 25 grams of icing sugar1 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 100 grams of red bean paste2 optional: 1 additional egg for brushing3 optional: sesame seeds  Preparation:   Cookie dough    whisk the egg in a bowl add the softened4 butter and mix until homogeneous add the flour, icing sugar and vanilla extract mix until smooth5 cover and refrigerate for one hour  Assembly    get the dough on a floured6 surface using a rolling pin, shape the dough into a long rectangle shape the red bean paste into a thick bar and place it in the middle of the rectangle carefully fold the two sides of the rectangle over the bar and flip it to put the seam down cut the resulting bar of dough into squarish cookies  Decoration    whisk the additional egg and brush the cookies with it7 sprinkle some sesame seeds on the cookies  Baking    bake 20 to 25 minutes at 360F (180C) let cool down a little before eating  Credits:   This recipe is mostly my notes on China Sichian Food&amp;rsquo;s Red Bean Paste Cookie.</description>

      <description>This breakfast manages to both be delicious and give you the feeling that you are eating healthy. And it feels good. I get the needed ingredients about once a month to eat it for a few days (I feel that eating it every day would reduce my enjoyment).
Ingredients (1 bowl):    two tablespoons of granola1 two tablespoons of unsweetened coconut milk yogurt2 two tablespoons of blueberries a few strawberries3  Preparation:    put the granola in a bowl add the yogurt wash and add the blueberries wash, dice and add the stawberries  Credits:   You can find similar recipes on Internet.</description>

      <description>This is the perfect recipe to do when you have leftover egg whites. It is delicious and uses barely any ingredients (I always keep the proper chocolate in my pantry to do this recipe when I have egg whites). Its only downside is that, once you have prepared everything, you need to wait.
Ingredients (1 portion):    1 egg whites1 35 grams of chocolate2  Preparation:    beat your egg whites into a nice firm foam melt the chocolate (it is okay to leave some chunks in the melted chocolate, they will add heterogeneity to the result) optionally, if you have egg yolks, add them to the melted chocolate and mix until homogeneous (be careful not to cook them in the hot chocolate) fold (or beat) the melted chocolate into the egg whites pour into one glass, mug, or bowl per portion store in the fridge for at least 5 hours (you can wait a full night if you want to be sure) eat cold (you can shave some chocolate on top if you want to make it look fancy)  Credits:   The proportions are inspired by this Mousse au chocolat facile recipe.</description>

      <description>Crêpes are the perfect social dish. You can make them together then everyone put the topping of their choice on top, sweet or savory1.
Ingredients (4 people):    250 grams flour 25 grams of sugar 4 eggs 500 ml milk 50 grams of salted butter (or 40 grams of olive oil and a pinch of salt, the taste is slightly different but it works)  Preparation:    put the flour in a mixing bowl add the sugar add the eggs and mix add the milk progressively while mixing add the melted butter (making sure it is not hot enough to cook the eggs prematurely) and mix  Cooking:    slightly oil (or butter) the pan put a ladle worth of crêpe batter and spread it to make it round once the bottom is cooked (the sides should start to get browned), use a spatula and flip it (it should cook for about a minute) repeat as many times as needed  Credits:   This recipe is my version of Crêpes : la meilleure recette rapide.</description>
