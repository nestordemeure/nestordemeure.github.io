      <description>Crumbles are basically impossible to miss and a great way to turn fruits (most fruits are suitable) and butter into a good cake. This one is pimped with chocolate chips, cinamon, vanilla extract and lemon juice (they are all worth it) but you can cut all of them if you want to keep things simple (or do not have them on hand).
Ingredients (for 4 portions):  100g of flour (you can easily turn the grams in cups and half cups: it is the respective proportions that matter) 100g of salted butter (you can also use unsalted butter and had some salt, the end result is identical, but do not omit the salt) 50g of sugar 2 large pears some good cooking chocolate (no need for a sweet one, 70% cacao does a good job, also I like to get a chocolate bar and cut it into small-ish chips, you get better quality chocolate and bigger chips) some cinnamon some vanilla extract some lemon juice  Preparation: bottom layer  peel the pears, dice them and put them on the bottom of your baking dish (I use a pyrex square one), you want enough pears to garnish the bottom of the dish with about 1cm of pears.</description>
