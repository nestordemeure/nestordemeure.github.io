</h2><p>The proportions are inspired by this <a href="https://www.marmiton.org/recettes/recette_mousse-au-chocolat-facile_13585.aspx">Mousse au chocolat facile</a> recipe.
My main contribution is to experiment with the recipe to see how far I could simplify it.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t despair if you have some full eggs, you will be able to use the egg yolks later in the recipe.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>This is the only source of sugar for the dessert so I recommend aiming for slightly sweeter than your sweet spot. I like to go with 70% cacao.&#160;<a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
