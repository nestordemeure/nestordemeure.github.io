                <p>The Krautburger is my favorite homemade burger of the moment.
It is vegetarian (but not vegan due to the presence of mayonnaise and, harder to replace, cheese) and light while hitting all the flavors I want due to the melted cheese and toasted bun combined with the surprising freshness of the thick tomato slice hidden inside the burger.</p>

        Ingredients (one burger):
    </a>
</h2><ul>
<li>a burger bun (bread rather than brioche if possible)</li>
<li>some mayonnaise</li>
<li>one tomato</li>
<li>enough sauerkraut to make a small patty out of it (pick one that is not too flavorful and whose flavor <em>you like</em>, otherwise you might be disappointed by this burger&hellip;)</li>
<li>2 slices of cheese (you want a cheese that does not melt instantly, so no American cheese, I like pepper jack because of the added flavor from the chili flakes, I would probably sprinkle some chilly flakes on my sauerkraut if all I had was Gruyère)</li>

        Preparation:
    </a>
</h2><ul>
<li>toast the lower bun (this step is optional but will reduce sogginess)</li>
<li>spread a layer of mayonnaise on each half-bun (the goal here is not to act on the taste but to stop water from going through and into the bun)</li>
<li>put thick tomato slices on the bottom bun until it is fully covered (I like my slices about one centimeter thick)</li>
<li>add one slice of cheese</li>
<li>put some sauerkraut on top and shape it like a small pattie</li>
<li>add the second slice of cheese</li>
<li>add the final bun</li>

</h2><p>This burger was born from some experimentation with leftovers.</p>
<p>The idea of using a thick slice of fresh tomato in a grilled sandwich and mayonnaise as insulation comes from the <a href="../bacontomatomelt">bacon tomato melt</a>.</p>
