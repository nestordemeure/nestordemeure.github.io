</div><p>While this dish&rsquo;s name is the combination of <em>Spaghetti Aglio E Olio</em> and the Italian word for spinach, it is inspired by wanting to do a pasta dish with spinach and having seen <a href="https://youtu.be/ntZebCEnjmI?list=PL_f8scwrXT8ut7l5Pu8x-YbWsLGo1uWsx">this Cacio E Pepe recipe</a> recently.
The desire to do a pasta dish with spinach and garlic was born from remembering a surprisingly good spinach and garlic dish I had a few years ago.</p>
<div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes">

<ol>
<li id="fn:1">
<p>I prefer to use long thin pasta such as spaghetti or tagliatelle for this recipe.
Ideally, you want pasta that will catch the sauce such as bronze-cut pasta but, you do not need to go that fancy with your ingredients here.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:2">
<p>Do <em>not</em> forget or omit the garlic. It is a key ingredient in the final flavor.&#160;<a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:3">
<p>Or any other dry, grated, Italian cheese. It is a component of the sauce so you can go for cheaper options without problems.&#160;<a href="#fnref:3" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:4">
<p>The pasta will taste better <em>and</em> it will help to salt the sauce later.&#160;<a href="#fnref:4" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:5">
<p>Be careful not to overdo it and let your pepper burn.&#160;<a href="#fnref:5" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:6">
<p>The salt is there to help the spinach let go of their water. Yes, it is a salty dish.&#160;<a href="#fnref:6" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:7">
<p>This is <em>not</em> a cheese sauce, better stay conservative with the amount of cheese. Too much cheese will lead to a heavier sauce.&#160;<a href="#fnref:7" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
