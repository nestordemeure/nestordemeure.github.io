      <description>This dish is slightly fancier than my usual weekday dish but it is good enough to have spoiled a lot of restaurant Carbonara pasta for me while being relatively fast and easy to cook. Plus, it is vegetarian!
Ingredients (for two portions):   160 grams of pasta (80 grams per person, you could go up to 100 grams), I like tagliatelle but, most pasta types would be fine1 half of a thick zucchini2 some olive oil some soy sauce two egg yolks3 some milk (about the same volume as the egg yolk) a lot of parmesan (at least the same volume as the egg yolk) a lot of black pepper (get a pepper grinder, you will get a much-improved taste) two big cloves of garlic4  Preparation:  Pasta   fill a pan with water and bring it to a boil you can optionally add a generous amount of salt to your pasta water, the pasta will taste better but, you do not need it here add the pasta when the water starts boiling and keep cooking for about 10 minutes (until your pasta is cooked)  Zucchini   peel your zucchini cut it into thin slices long as about a third of a bacon strip put in a wok with a splash of olive oil add a splash of soy sauce let cook until the pasta is ready  Sauce   put the egg yolks in a bowl add the milk add the parmesan add black pepper (you can, optionally, also add some chili flakes here) add the crushed garlic mix thoroughly and set aside  Assembly   once the pasta is cooked, add a splash of pasta water to the wok, this will help with the sauce consistency (you can be approximate with the quantity, too little and your sauce will miss a bit of thickness, too much and you will have to reduce longer: either way the result will be fine and you can do better next time) you can do it directly from the pasta pan, no need for an intermediate container (that would give you additional opportunities to burn yourself) strain the pasta and add them to the wok (it is okay if there is some pasta water left with the pasta, we have pasta water in the wok anyway) set the heat to low add the sauce and mix constantly (to avoid having the egg yolk curl) until you reach the desired consistency (I recommend aiming for slightly more liquid than your sweet spot, the sauce will thicken further once served) serve on a plate5  Credits:  This is my take on Adam Raguseas&amp;rsquo;s carbonara pasta with zucchini.</description>

      <description>This dish is all about the pleasure of eating rice with Parmesan and butter, with some zucchini tossed in for good measure. It is quick to do and delicious, try it on a weekday.
Ingredients (one person):   Half a zucchini, 60 grams of rice, a lot of salted butter1, as much Parmesan as butter, optionally, some smoked chilly flakes for added flavor complexity.  Preparation:   Peel the Zucchini and dice it, bring water to a boil, add the rice and zucchini to the water and cook for ten minutes2, put the butter on the plate, add the (optional) chilly flakes, once the rice and zucchini are cooked, strain and pour on the butter add the Parmesan and mix.</description>

      <description>This dish is very fast to cook, brings you the carbs you need, some greens (technically reds), and has a distinct enough flavor to fight monotony in your eating habits.
Ingredients (for two portions):   160 grams of pasta (80 grams per person, you could go up to 100 grams), I like fusilli for this dish but most pasta types would be fine 1 bell pepper (all colors are fine, but I have a slight preference for red as it imparts some color to the pasta) some salted soy sauce (the salt will be useful) some olive oil (we will cook it so no need for high-quality stuff) some herbes de Provence (you could use another dry herbs mix but do use dry herbs, they make the flavor of the dish) some cayenne pepper (optional)  Preparation:  Pasta   fill a pan with water and bring it to a boil (big bubbles, small bubbles do not count as boiling, you will be delighted to discover that I met people for which this is not obvious) add the pasta when the water starts boiling and keep cooking for about 10 minutes (until your pasta is cooked)  Sauce   once the pasta is in the water, put the diced bell pepper in a wok (or similar large pan) on low heat add a generous splash of olive oil add a generous splash of soy sauce (this will bring you the salt in the dish plus a lot of the flavor) add a very generous sprinkle of herbs (you can hardly overdo it here) optionally, add a sprinkle of cayenne pepper (you want enough for people to realize the dish has some hotness but no more, it is not a hot dish) cook on low heat  Assembly   once the pasta is cooked, add a splash of pasta water to the wok, this will help with the sauce consistency (you can be approximate with the quantity, too little and your sauce will miss a bit of thickness, too much and you will have to reduce longer: either way the result will be fine and you can do better next time) you can do it directly from the pasta pan, no need for an intermediate container (that would give you additional opportunities to burn yourself) strain the pasta and add them to the wok (it is okay if there is some pasta water left with the pasta, we have pasta water in the wok anyway) raise to medium heat and keep mixing until you get the sauce consistency you want (the mixing time will depend on the amount of water you put, you should be done in two minutes) serve on a plate, feel free to add butter and shredded Parmesan to pimp the result slightly  Credits:  Using the pasta water comes from French guy cooking&amp;rsquo;s Alex and is a game-changer for pasta sauces.</description>

      <description>This dish is a worker: it is fast and easy to cook while being delicious and rich in vegetables and flavors.
I have been cooking variations of this dish for as long as I have been cooking for myself, starting when I had my first apartment. It has evolved a lot since its inception but it is still one of my favorite way to eat pasta.
Ingredients (for two portions):   160 grams of pasta (80 grams per person, you could go up to 100 grams), I like fusilli for this dish but most pasta types would be fine half a jar of organic1 ratatouille (this is where I lose my US readers, you simply cannot find this stuff in the US: you might replace it with a jar of tomato sauce that contains a generous amount of eggplants and assorted vegetables) some salted soy sauce (the salt will be useful) some olive oil (we will cook it so no need for high-quality stuff) some salt (optional) some cayenne pepper (optional)  Preparation:  Pasta   fill a pan with water and bring it to a boil (big bubbles, small bubbles do not count as boiling, you will be delighted to discover that I met people for which this is not obvious) you can optionally add a generous amount of salt to your pasta water, the pasta will taste better but, you do not need it here add the pasta when the water starts boiling and keep cooking for about 10 minutes (until your pasta is cooked)  Sauce   once the pasta is in the water, put the ratatouille in a wok (or similar large pan) on low heat add a generous splash of olive oil add a generous splash of soy sauce (this will bring you the salt in the dish plus a lot of the flavor) optionally, add a sprinkle of cayenne pepper (you want enough for people to realize the dish has some hotness but no more, it is not a hot dish) cook on low heat  Assembly   once the pasta is cooked, add a splash of pasta water to the wok, this will help with the sauce consistency (you can be approximate with the quantity, too little and your sauce will miss a bit of thickness, too much and you will have to reduce longer: either way the result will be fine and you can do better next time) you can do it directly from the pasta pan, no need for an intermediate container (that would give you additional opportunities to burn yourself) strain the pasta and add them to the wok (it is okay if there is some pasta water left with the pasta, we have pasta water in the wok anyway) raise to medium heat and keep mixing until you get the sauce consistency you want (the mixing time will depend on the amount of water you put, you should be done in two minutes) serve on a plate, feel free to add butter and shredded Parmesan to pimp the result slightly  Credits:  I used soy sauce and a jar of ratatouille because my father put them in my very first grocery bag as an independent student.</description>
