<li>160 grams of pasta (80 grams per person, you could go up to 100 grams), I like fusilli for this dish but most pasta types would be fine</li>
<li>1 bell pepper (all colors are fine, but I have a slight preference for red as it imparts some color to the pasta)</li>
<li>some salted soy sauce (the salt will be useful)</li>
<li>some olive oil (we will cook it so no need for high-quality stuff)</li>
<li>some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbes_de_Provence">herbes de Provence</a> (you could use another dry herbs mix but do use dry herbs, they make the flavor of the dish)</li>

<li>fill a pan with water and bring it to a boil (big bubbles, small bubbles do <em>not</em> count as boiling, you will be delighted to discover that I met people for which this is not obvious)</li>

<li>once the pasta is in the water, put the diced bell pepper in a wok (or similar large pan) on low heat</li>
<li>add a generous splash of olive oil</li>
<li>add a generous splash of soy sauce (this will bring you the salt in the dish plus a lot of the flavor)</li>
<li>add a very generous sprinkle of herbs (you can hardly overdo it here)</li>
<li>optionally, add a sprinkle of cayenne pepper (you want enough for people to realize the dish has some hotness but no more, it is not a hot dish)</li>

<li>strain the pasta and add them to the wok (it is okay if there is some pasta water left with the pasta, we have pasta water in the wok anyway)</li>
