</h2><p>I used soy sauce and a jar of ratatouille because my father put them in my very first grocery bag as an independent student.</p>
<p>Using the pasta water comes from <a href="https://youtu.be/Ng7GWl57nQM">French guy cooking&rsquo;s Alex</a> and is a game-changer for pasta sauces.</p>
<p>The cayenne pepper comes, obviously, from <a href="https://foodwishes.blogspot.com/">food wishes&rsquo; Chef John</a>.</p>

<p>Being organic or not usually doesn&rsquo;t matter taste-wise, but this is the big exception, I found jars of non-organic ratatouille to have a slightly sour taste which is a significant downgrade for this dish.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
