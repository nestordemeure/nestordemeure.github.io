<p>Ideally you want pasta that will catch the sauce. Ridged pasta is a fine option, bronze cut pasta would be the fancy way to go.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:2">
<p>Or a few strips of bacon if you don&rsquo;t want to go vegetarian. You would cut the slices in half and cook them in their fat before adding the pasta and sauce.&#160;<a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:3">
<p>You can reserve the egg whites for <a href="https://nestordemeure.github.io/cooking/sweet/chocolate_mousse">another recipe</a>.&#160;<a href="#fnref:3" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:4">
<p>Do <em>not</em> forget or omit the garlic. It is a key ingredient in the final flavor.&#160;<a href="#fnref:4" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:5">
<p>The garlic flavor diffuses nicely with time making this a very nice dish to rewarm the next day. To do so just warm up your wok while mixing constantly (you can add a small splash of water if the sauce is too thick).&#160;<a href="#fnref:5" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
