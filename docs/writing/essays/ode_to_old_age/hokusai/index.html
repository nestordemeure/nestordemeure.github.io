                <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hokusai">Hokusai</a> is considered one of the greatest masters in the history of art.
Even if you do not know his name, you <em>have</em> seen a reproduction or a take on his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Great_Wave_off_Kanagawa2.jpg">Great Wave off Kanagawa</a>.</p>
<p>In his seventies, shortly after making <em>the Great Wave off Kanagawa</em>, he wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;From the age of six, I had a passion for copying the form of things and since the age of fifty I have published many drawings, yet of all I drew by my seventieth year there is nothing worth taking into account.</em></p>
<p><em>At seventy-three years I partly understood the structure of animals, birds, insects and fishes, and the life of grasses and plants.</em></p>
<p><em>And so, at eighty-six I shall progress further; at ninety I shall even further penetrate their secret meaning, and by one hundred I shall perhaps truly have reached the level of the marvellous and divine.</em></p>
<p><em>When I am one hundred and ten, each dot, each line will possess a life of its own.&rdquo;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>He continued to paint until his death, at age 88, at which point he is rumored to have said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;If only Heaven will give me just another ten years &hellip; Just another five more years, then I could become a real painter&rdquo;</em></p>
