<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper">Grace Hopper</a> was both an admiral of the US navy and a pioneer of computer science, introducing some concepts that are now fundamental to programming.</p>
<p>She tried to enlist in the navy at the beginning of the second world war but was rejected due to being too old (then aged 34) and had to wait a few years before being able to join the reserve.</p>
<p>At age 46 she wrote the very first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linker_(computing)">linker</a> (<em>&ldquo;a running compiler and nobody would touch it. They told me computers could only do arithmetic.&rdquo;</em>).
She then started working on the idea of a machine-independent programming language, letting people program using human words instead of a machine-specific assembly, leading to the creation of the language <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBOL">COBOL</a> at age 53.</p>
<p>At age 77 she was awarded the rank commodore (that would later be turned into admiral).
She retired at 79, then the oldest active-duty commissioned officer in the United States Navy.</p>
