                <p>The opposite of wanting something to be perfect is following <strong>the easy path</strong>: knowing that some things could be done to make your project objectively better but keeping the current version because it is <em>&ldquo;good enough&rdquo;</em>.</p>
<p>This, <em>as long as the modification would be within the scope and allotted time</em><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, is a form of laziness.
However, it is insidious. All parts of a project have to be considered <em>&ldquo;good enough&rdquo;</em> before you let go of them to tackle the next step, it is very easy to not realize that your motivation shifted from an objective look at the quality of your work toward avoiding additional work to the detriment of the result.</p>
<p>Knowing that the easy path exists helps recognize when it happens and turns an unconscious process into a conscious one where you can weigh the pro and cons of the decision properly.
However, the most efficient way to fight the easy path is to have other people take a look at your work and give you constructive feedback.
As they do not have to work to implement the modifications they are suggesting, they will be naturally immune to the easy path.
You might still try and resist tooth and nails but, now that you know what the easy path is, you can distinguish between laziness and justified cuts.</p>
