                <p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failure_of_imagination">failure of imagination</a> is usually a bad outcome that, despite being predictable, is not imagined and thus not planned for.
I however use the expression in a positive light, to speak of a good outcome that, despite being possible, is not imagined and thus not explored.
I know of two failures of imagination:</p>
<p>The first failure of imagination is <em>imagining that something is impossible</em> unless proven otherwise. And even then, one should be attentive to the hypotheses that went into the proof as well as what exactly has been proven impossible<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The second failure of imagination is <em>doing things the way everyone else does</em>. Because one does not even realize that there is another way.</p>

<p>I learned how to prove that something is not possible using math. Then engineering taught me that something being impossible usually just meant that I needed to consider a larger set of tools or a finer definition of the problem I want solved. Most things are possible up to an acceptable threshold.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
