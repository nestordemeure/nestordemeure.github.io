    <h2 id="do-a-bad-version-first">
        <a class="heading-anchor" href="#do-a-bad-version-first" style="text-decoration: none">
            Do a bad version first
        </a>
    </h2>
</div><p>Stealing advice from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Harmon">Dan Harmon</a>, <em>start by writing something bad</em>.</p>
<p>The human mind is terrible at writing something perfect in one go but very good at criticizing things.
So, instead of getting stuck on trying to write a good first draft, let&rsquo;s accept that it will be bad and push forward until we have written all the things that need to be written.
Then, you can improve it progressively to make it good.</p>
<p>That frees you from some forms of writer&rsquo;s block (just write, never mind that it is bad) and shows you the proper way to produce something good: iterating on it.</p>
<div class="heading-wrapper">
    <h2 id="make-it-look-good-fast">
        <a class="heading-anchor" href="#make-it-look-good-fast" style="text-decoration: none">
            Make it look good fast
        </a>
    </h2>
</div><p>This is not always possible but, I found that making my draft look as close as possible to the final result is highly motivating.
This can sometimes be done by having a tool to export your draft as a formatted PDF (such as <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes">LaTeX</a> via <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/">Overleaf</a>), <a href="https://nestordemeure.github.io/writing/guides/blogging/">HTML</a>, etc.</p>
<p>While purely a matter of perspective, it puts you in the right state of mind to finish the project. It helps you see your project as a <em>finished product with holes to be filled</em> rather than as an idea quickly thrown on paper.</p>
<div class="heading-wrapper">
    <h2 id="give-yourself-time">
        <a class="heading-anchor" href="#give-yourself-time" style="text-decoration: none">
            Give yourself time
        </a>
    </h2>
</div><p>When you work on a piece of text, your mind gets used to it and its quirks. You lose the ability to judge it objectively.</p>
<p>My solution is to do a few passes on the text then, once it stops evolving, <em>wait</em>.
Give myself a handful of days away from the text, both writing and reading, before going back to it.
I then do further passes until it stops evolving once more and repeat the cycle as many times as necessary, with longer and longer breaks<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, until the text convergences.</p>
<div class="heading-wrapper">
    <h2 id="make-a-plan-full-of-holes">
        <a class="heading-anchor" href="#make-a-plan-full-of-holes" style="text-decoration: none">
            Make a plan full of holes
        </a>
    </h2>
</div><p>I am a planner.
Some people think that they are not good at making plans and structuring their output but, I believe that it is a skill acquired by practice, you <em>will</em> start being bad at planning which might lead you to give up before getting good at it.</p>
<p>Being a planner, I believe that you should start with a plan<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.
Then, for all sections of your plan, you make a plan.
Repeating the process until you have a clear idea of what you are going to say in each unit of text (which could be somewhere between a chapter, a paragraph or a sentence)<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Once you know what to say<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>, you should be able to write a bad version of it fairly easily.
And once you have a bad version of everything, <em>you have a first draft!</em>
You can now iterate on it until it becomes good.</p>
<div class="heading-wrapper">
    <h2 id="listen-to-your-editors">
        <a class="heading-anchor" href="#listen-to-your-editors" style="text-decoration: none">
            Listen to your editors
        </a>
    </h2>
</div><p>If you <em>respect</em> the opinions of one of your readers then they are a de-facto editor (most likely for free!).</p>
<p>Editors are precious, they have an outside perspective that let them see weaknesses in your text that you cannot see due to being submerged in it (structural problems, lack of information given to the reader, terrible spelling, etc.).
Furthermore, they do not have to work to correct the shortcomings they notice so laziness does not stop them from aiming for perfection (they are naturally immune to <a href="https://nestordemeure.github.io/writing/concepts/easy_path">the easy path</a>).</p>
<p>However, you are a human being and your text is your precious baby.
You <em>will be</em> tempted to fight them and tell them that none of the things they suggest would be an improvement, they are just picky!
My suggestion to you would be to make a copy of your work and <em>try their suggestions</em>.
You have nothing to lose, and they are likely right (after all, you respect their opinion for a reason).</p>
<p>There is a risk of losing your vision, letting it be diluted by different positions, but it is part of your job to have a clear vision.
You have to know what you want, everything else can be improved on with patience and enough work.</p>

<li id="fn:1">
<p>I read about an author who had to set a draft aside for a year due to family reasons and highly recommended the experience.
She explained that it freed her completely from any attachment to the text, letting her focus on the quality of the book.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:2">
<p>Once you have an idea, you can even use a ready-made plan.
For fiction, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero%27s_journey">the Hero&rsquo;s journey</a> is <em>the</em> classic on the subject.
<a href="https://savethecat.com/">Save the cat</a> might be its best know incarnation amongst screenwriters but, I am partial to Dan Harmon&rsquo;s version: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Harmon#%22Story_circle%22_technique">the story circle</a>. Mostly because it feels detailed enough to give me a frame while being high-level enough to not feel formulaic.&#160;<a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:3">
<p>This shares some similarities with <a href="https://www.advancedfictionwriting.com/articles/snowflake-method/">the snowflake method</a>.&#160;<a href="#fnref:3" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:4">
<p>I like to put this information in my text, highlighted in yellow, it makes it easy to find and replace later.&#160;<a href="#fnref:4" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:5">
<p>A lot of this advice is shared with my <a href="https://nestordemeure.github.io/writing/guides/hard_things/">guide to doing a large project</a>. I highly recommend that you consult it.&#160;<a href="#fnref:5" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
