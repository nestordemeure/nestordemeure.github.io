    content="Here are some heuristics I use in life and work:
Play to your strengths; being balanced sounds nice but ends up being really unproductive/unpleasant. Spend time on the things you like, as time and practice pile up you will end up skilled in those domains. Go for the things that are of interest to you, not for the trendy ones. Time spent automating tasks is usually time well spent. Taking a break to gather knowledge on something vaguely connected to the thing you are doing is never time lost. When you have been procrastinating something for most of the day, declare that you will not do it today and that it is okay; it will free your mind to do other things instead of leaving you stuck. Try and do one, single and quantifiable, thing a day. With time, they pile up, and you end up doing a lot of things. The mind is good at criticizing something but bad at doing something from scratch: instead of trying to produce perfection, do a rough draft and then improve on it incrementally. Also, be nice, kind, and nonjudgmental to people. " />
