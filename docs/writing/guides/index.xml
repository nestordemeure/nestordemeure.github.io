      <description>STATUS: DRAFT
Disclaimer: I have written non-fiction professionally in various fields but never published any fiction so take the following with the appropriate amount of salt. Also, a lot of this advice is shared with my guide to doing a large project. I highly recommend that you consult it.
Do a bad version first  Stealing advice from Dan Harmon, start by writing something bad.
The human mind is terrible at writing something perfect in one go but very good at criticizing things.</description>

      <title>Nestor&#39;s guide to creating a blog</title>
      <link>https://nestordemeure.github.io/writing/guides/blogging/</link>

      <description>Disclaimer: this guide is mostly about me keeping a trace of the process I followed to create this blog. I really wanted to use GitHub for the hosting and that leads to a lot of additional complexity that you should avoid if you are not used to writing code.
Hosting  I used GitHub pages to host my blog, they are free but only support static websites and, by default, force you to use their domain.</description>

      <description>Tackling a large project (this applies to anything including a book, a piece of software or a movie for example) can be daunting. Suddenly it is not a sprint to the end of a task but, rather, an endurance race that requires regularly renewed dedication: something school and early life does not prepare you for.
These are my solutions to tackle large projects (you will find some overlap with my guide to doing the things you love well and my guide to writing).</description>

      <description>Disclaimer: This guide is targeted at heterosexual men (with a focus on people looking for a relationship) and was written at the end of 2021 for a friend, the content might not apply to you. Also, a lot of the following might seem obvious to you but, as what is obvious to some isnâ€™t to others, I am putting a maximum of information here in the hope that you might find things that you do not already know.</description>

      <title>Nestor&#39;s guide to doing the things you love well</title>
      <link>https://nestordemeure.github.io/writing/guides/heuristics/</link>

      <description>Here are some heuristics I use in life and work:
 Play to your strengths, being balanced sounds nice but end up being really unproductive / unpleasant. Spend time on the things you like, as time and practice pile up you will end up skilled in those domains. Go for the things that are of interest to you, not for the trendy ones. Time spend automating tasks is usually time well spent.</description>

      <title>Nestor&#39;s guide to having ideas</title>
      <link>https://nestordemeure.github.io/writing/guides/ideas/</link>

      <description>No one is born uncreative  Some people have told me that they are not creative. It usually stems from them thinking that creativity is an innate gift: some people are born with a brain that overflow with ideas at regular intervals while others stay dry for most of their life.
In practice, I found creativity to be a muscle. The more you try to use it and the easier it gets.</description>
