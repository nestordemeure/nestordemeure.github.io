Once the hole was big enough, he wrapped a silver dollar in one original page of Krazy Kat and buried it in the dirt. Then, he waited.

                <p>Jim started digging at the crossroad. He felt heavy, he wasn’t quite sure if it was the pasta or the meat, but eating before coming was probably a bad idea… but it&rsquo;s not as if he had experience with this stuff.</p>
<p>Once the hole was big enough, he wrapped a silver dollar in one original page of Krazy Kat and buried it in the dirt. Then, he waited.</p>
<p>A fly started to bother him. Hopefully, a sign of success. Maybe, a sign that someone somewhere had received the offerings. Maybe, just a fly.</p>
<p>It was just a fly.</p>
<p>It took a good hour before someone showed up. It was a man, smallish, blond, blue eyes, baseball cap, and military jacket.</p>
<p>“Hi Jim! Happy Monday! Bought something for the wife? Your anniversary is coming up soon!”</p>
<p>Jim had never met the man and was not quite sure what to answer. But it did not really care for an answer.</p>
<p>“The name’s M̵̠̄a̷̯̐m̸͓̀m̴̰͝ȯ̵͚̾͜n̴͔͔͆ , but you can call me mom. Me and the boys discussed and I might have a job for you. You see, I have a project I am <em>really</em> looking forward to. It&rsquo;s a comic strip, kind of funny, but not really, but it stays in your head afterward. God, does it burrow and dig itself a space in your head… Think of the market opportunity!”</p>
<p>The man had perfect teeth.</p>
<p>“Trust me, I have done that with songs in the past – the Java was great but also kind of limited, you cannot really produce merch around a song – this will be a million times better.</p>
<p>It would be a pretty standard contract: fame and fortune for you, what you love most – plus perks – for me. I would tell you what to draw, how to draw it, and you will never, ever, draw something else. No original work, no one-off comic strip, no glimpses of your soul in between the jokes. Clean corporate material.</p>
<p>Interested? You are going to <em>love</em> the lead character, he is called Garfield…”</p>
