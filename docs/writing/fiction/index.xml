      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a kid, I knew that there were wolves in the dark. Scrawny wolves walking naked on their hind legs. Wolves that talk to you before eating you, but wolves nonetheless. Wolves you forget as soon as they leave your field of vision.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At night, I would turn the lights on, progressively, carefully, as I went from my bedroom, through a corridor, down the stairs, by the underground cellar, to the toilets.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>On a Monday Darkly.</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Jim started digging at the crossroad. He felt heavy, he wasn’t quite sure if it was the pasta or the meat, but eating before coming was probably a bad idea… but it&amp;rsquo;s not as if he had experience with this stuff.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once the hole was big enough, he wrapped a silver dollar in one original page of Krazy Kat and buried it in the dirt. Then, he waited.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A fly started to bother him. Hopefully, a sign of success. Maybe, a sign that someone somewhere had received the offerings. Maybe, just a fly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This text, written in collaboration with ChatGPT, is&lt;/em&gt; not &lt;em&gt;about an AI taking over the world.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hana, the head of the software development team, reclined in her chair, seeking a brief respite from her work. She absentmindedly clicked on her Reddit bookmark, hoping for a few minutes of distraction. To her surprise, the site was unresponsive. As if on cue, Tom, one of her engineers, strode towards her desk, exuding an unmistakable air of urgency. &amp;ldquo;Hana, we&amp;rsquo;ve stumbled upon a critical issue,&amp;rdquo; he murmured, his voice barely audible.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Eldritch Academia (annotated)</title>
      <link>https://nestordemeure.github.io/writing/fiction/eldritch_academia_anotated/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 13 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://nestordemeure.github.io/writing/fiction/eldritch_academia_anotated/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the annotated edition of &lt;a href=&#34;https://nestordemeure.github.io/writing/fiction/eldritch_academia/&#34;&gt;Eldritch Academia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;. I expect it to be of very limited interest to others (the short story is probably not worth an annotated edition) but, it is a fun way to record some of the thoughts and references I put in the text and an exercise in overloading a page with sidenotes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;My overall feeling about the story is that it lacks conflict, probably because the narrator is not resisting. Plus, it reaches its end very quickly, maybe too fast to let the reader understand that a transformation is happening.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
