To answer your question (sorry for the late email, moving did not leave me much time to write), the math department is paying me to study KTu-L spaces.
You might have seen some reference to them popping up in the past year, they have gained a lot of visibility as some mathematicians (mostly Providenceâ€™s research team which I will be joining this week) claim that they can be used to solve a number of interesting conjectures.</description>
