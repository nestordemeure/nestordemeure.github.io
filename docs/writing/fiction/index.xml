      <description>As a kid, I knew that there were wolves in the dark. Scrawny wolves walking naked on their hind legs. Wolves that talk to you before eating you, but wolves nonetheless. Wolves you forget as soon as they leave your field of vision.
At night, I would turn the lights on, progressively, carefully, as I went from my bedroom, through a corridor, down the stairs, by the underground cellar, to the toilets.</description>

      <title>On a Monday Darkly.</title>

      <description>Jim started digging at the crossroad. He felt heavy, he wasn’t quite sure if it was the pasta or the meat, but eating before coming was probably a bad idea… but it&amp;rsquo;s not as if he had experience with this stuff.
Once the hole was big enough, he wrapped a silver dollar in one original page of Krazy Kat and buried it in the dirt. Then, he waited.
A fly started to bother him.</description>

      <description>This text, written in collaboration with ChatGPT, is not about an AI taking over the world.
 Hana, the head of the software development team, reclined in her chair, seeking a brief respite from her work. She absentmindedly clicked on her Reddit bookmark, hoping for a few minutes of distraction. To her surprise, the site was unresponsive. As if on cue, Tom, one of her engineers, strode towards her desk, exuding an unmistakable air of urgency.</description>

      <title>Eldritch Academia (annotated)</title>

      <description>This is the annotated edition of Eldritch Academia1. I expect it to be of very limited interest to others (the short story is probably not worth an annotated edition) but, it is a fun way to record some of the thoughts and references I put in the text and an exercise in overloading a page with sidenotes.
My overall feeling about the story is that it lacks conflict, probably because the narrator is not resisting.</description>

      <description>Object: Some News   Hey Sonia,
How are you doing?
To answer your question (sorry for the late email, moving did not leave me much time to write), the math department is paying me to study KTu-L spaces.
You might have seen some references to them popping up in the past year, they have gained a lot of visibility as some mathematicians (mostly Providence’s research team which I will be joining this week) claim that they can be used to solve a number of interesting conjectures.</description>
