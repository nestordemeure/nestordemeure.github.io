    content=" Treat any friend as if he may one day become your enemy. It is dangerous for a single individual to become too powerful within any group or organization. When you desire something, let no one notice your intentions until you have obtained it. Stay vigilant and anticipate potential pitfalls to prevent them from occurring. Resolve matters through peaceful means whenever possible, avoiding war or disputes. Accept small losses instead of risking everything for potentially significant but uncertain gains. Acting too rashly or aggressively is risky. The best approach is to take a moderate approach and avoid extremes. Know all things, reveal nothing; treat everyone with courtesy, but be cautious about acting too openly or candidly with others. It is advantageous to remain neutral between opposing groups or parties. Be skeptical towards all and do not expect preferential treatment. Even if you do not follow the majority&rsquo;s position, do not criticize it. Be cautious about blindly following your passions, as they may lead you astray or cloud your judgment. Plan giving gifts and feasting as if you were planning a military campaign. Revealing a secret can be more dangerous than holding captive an enemy plotting against your life. " />
