                <p>Are you overcome by anger, fear, rashness, or some other strong emotion?
What defects are evident in your conduct during various activities, such as dining, attending church, conversing, playing games, or engaging in other social interactions?</p>
<p>Examine all the parts of your body: are your eyes too insolent, foot or head bent too far, forehead wrinkled, lips unkempt, gait too slow or too fast?</p>
<p>With whom do you associate? Are they praiseworthy, successful, prudent individuals?</p>
<p>At what times are you most likely to act carelessly or recklessly? Do you stumble in word or deed when drinking at the table, playing games, or facing calamity? As <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacitus">Tacitus</a> noted, &ldquo;the minds of mortals are pliable&rdquo; during such moments.</p>
<p>What places do you visit - are they suspect, vile, disreputable, unworthy of you?</p>
<p>Be always cautious in your actions, to which end reading this little book will serve.</p>
<p>Consider the place, time, situation, and the rank of the persons with whom you are interacting.</p>
<p>Make note of each of your individual defect, so that you may address it more diligently; whenever you slip up, it will be beneficial to discipline yourself strictly.</p>
<p>If you are provoked to the point of anger, remain silent and show no sign of it, especially when you cannot effectively express your zeal or satisfy yourself. Instead, <em>pretend</em> that you are not offended and wait for a more opportune moment. Show nothing in your face except kindness, or even affection.</p>
<p>Do not readily laugh at just any witticism.</p>
<p>Strive to have everyone figured out. Never reveal your secrets to anyone; fish for the secrets of others.</p>
<p>Say or do nothing indecorous in the presence of anyone, even if it is natural and not malicious, such things are despised by others.</p>
<p>Maintain a modest and steady demeanor, but keenly observe everything with sharp eyes and an inquisitive expression. Those who do so are considered prudent, astute, and precise.</p>
