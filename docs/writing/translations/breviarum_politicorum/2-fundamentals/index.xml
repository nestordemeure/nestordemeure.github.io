      <description>Much can be learned about someone&amp;rsquo;s true character in situations like sickness, drunkenness, gain or loss of money, games, and travel. When the doors of the mind are relaxed, the wild beasts more readily emerge from their dens.

Examine all the parts of your body: are your eyes too insolent, foot or head bent too far, forehead wrinkled, lips unkempt, gait too slow or fast?
With whom do you associate? Are they praiseworthy, successful, prudent individuals?</description>
