BEING ACCUSED.

If you realize that someone has accused you, do not immediately reveal in which matter you were denounced. Correct yourself so that the accuser does not suspect that he has been found out and that his denunciation has been favorably received by the person to whom it was reported. In fact, say that, given the opportunity, he is both an enemy and an informant, and while he may be wished for as traitors usually are, he is never loved, etc. This person is used to arguing that if he portrays others in such a way before me, there is even less wisdom and harmony among them; they are not associates, but critics. And if he accepts them as useful, he will still, in time, show the effects of his feelings towards such people.

In grief, take up business as a solace for holidays so that you may be distracted: Hate the one who denounced you, consult what must be done in this denunciation, and ask as if from a close friend. When speaking about you before another person, intending to alert you to their presence, speak ill in front of this same person and well about a third person with whom you are involved. At the beginning of the dispute, show the accuser as being simple, or have the trial conducted in their presence, especially in those matters which are pleasing so that the accuser may be dismissed by the judges in due course. If you are accused of multiple things, do not lose credibility by denying everything; acknowledge some, even if false, so that you do not appear completely inflexible and not entirely prone to error. It will often help if you know you have been reported to the Lord; if he does not demand it, do not clear yourself. You will cause more agitation and entangle yourself, but avoid that beginning by either avoiding it or acting contrarily.
