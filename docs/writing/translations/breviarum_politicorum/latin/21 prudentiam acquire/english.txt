ACQUIRE PRUDENCE.

For the most part, be silent, listen to the advice of others, and carefully consider it. Be cautious not to be carried away by the passion of love. Do not value your words and actions too highly. Do not involve yourself in useless matters or those that will not be of any use in the future. Also, do not involve yourself in the affairs of others. Freely attribute the glory of your accomplishments to others, even if you have contributed significantly to them. This will return to you with favor, that is, without envy. Avoid anger and revenge. When the virtues of others are being recounted, listen willingly. Rarely marvel at something new. Give advice sparingly. Do not act out of rivalry. Avoid disputes, even sometimes at your own expense. Do not show off your valuable or easily desirable possessions to anyone.

If someone urges you to do something, make sure they are willing to share in the risk.

If you need to make a request, persuasion, or undertake some business, first read and seek similar cases in history to inform yourself. Read the works of rhetoricians from time to time, for they suggest ways to provoke, deflect, excuse, or diminish envy, and so on. Occasionally use ambiguous words so that your speech may seem clear to both parties, but nothing is actually concluded, and you can always escape through different interpretations. Sometimes necessity forces you to use this tactic, a technique that, according to Nazianzen, Aristotle employed when writing his opinions.

Use this method in books, in offensive letters, and in giving advice; form arguments for both sides in the manner of a discourse, but do not make it clear which side you adhere to or should adhere to. Instead of declaring your position, use a digression or amphibology, expressing your feelings through some rhetorical technique. Allow yourself to be admonished, even about falsehoods, without offering excuses; no one will warn you afterward. Rather, show every emotion because it is useful. Let the useless things said pass, and even refute some of them.

Practice giving arguments for both sides; for this, read the methods of rhetoricians and apologies.

If you are an ambassador and dealing with an enemy, attribute any gifts you receive from them to your prince to dispel any suspicion of infidelity. Apply this principle to other situations as well.

Do not send an ambassador who is opposed to you, as they will give contrary advice.

Appoint advisers of different temperaments and talents (since finding moderate ones is rare). Consult one who is cold, another who is fiery, one who is gentle, and another who is harsh. In this way, you can establish and decide what is best from the diverse advice.

Always pay attention to the direction fortune is turning, or can be turned, and have even the smallest servants of the prince attached to your cause.

Set aside several hours on specific days to think about what you would do if this or that were to happen.

Keep a diary for your servants and friends, divided into four columns. In the first, note the harm done by someone who has failed in their duty. In the second, what good you have done for them and at what effort. In the third, what they have done for you. In the fourth, the inconveniences they have caused you and the extraordinary tasks they have imposed. In this way, you will have at hand something to counter complaints and boastfulness. Use these rules in conversation each day.

Whether justly or unjustly reprimanded by a superior, always make excuses in the presence of others and speak well of them.

Do not easily promise anything in writing, especially to women.

Avoid, if possible, what attracts you with the greatest affection and desire, or at least approach it very cautiously. Strengthen your position and actions, even if they seem firm, as much as possible. After an action has passed, examine both your own and others' actions, considering what was lacking, when it could have been captured, when it could have been better executed, and so on.
