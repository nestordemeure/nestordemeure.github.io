GAINING FAVOR FOR ONESELF.

Understand what pleases your friend and give gifts suited to their interests. If they are fond of mathematics, mathematical gifts would be appropriate; if they are curious about physics, sharing the secrets of nature found in Mizaldus would be suitable.

Speak to them often, consult them, ask for their advice, and use it; but never reveal yourself so much that, if they become an enemy, they have something to harm you with. Do not ask for anything that would be difficult to grant, such as matters involving personal interests. Offer congratulations for solemn celebrations, birthdays, good health, etc., using brief but elegant speeches.
Rarely acknowledge their virtues, always hide their vices, relay praise others have given them, and whisper all things into their ears, especially those spoken by superiors; never reveal their disapproval or faults, no matter how they ask. If they press you, so you do not appear distrustful, at least report the slightest faults or those they have mentioned about themselves.
For such things leave a sharp memory of oneself, no matter how they are spoken; especially if they are drawn too much from the truth. Greet them often through others and in others' letters; write to them frequently. Never defend or insist on an opinion contrary to theirs, and if you have dared to insist, let yourself be taught and humbled by them, and hide your humiliation. Be generous in giving titles and eager to offer services, the opportunity for which may never or hardly arise. Do not try to please anyone through vice; indeed, not even through those appearances that conflict with your status; for example, if you are a clergyman, refrain from excessive joking, vulgarity, and heavy drinking.
For even if these behaviors win love for the moment, they ultimately lead to contempt and ridicule; indeed, they provoke sharp hatred, even if not immediately. Therefore, even if it is enjoyable to relax one's mind occasionally, do it without vice.

If you come to someone, first learn who has favor with the lord of the place, who prevails through factions and wit. Win their favor in every possible way, for they will be useful in many ways. You can use their advice in promoting matters because, as they give advice, they become part of the care.

If you want to avenge yourself on someone, make them suspect; envy towards them will serve your cause.

Do not commit any crime at the command of your lord; for though you may please them for the moment, you will later be seen as a reproacher and will be thought capable of doing the same to your lord, as you easily accepted their order like a man for sale, without loyalty or virtue, or at least you will depart as soon as you receive the reward for the deed.

Write some honorable letters about a third party and allow them to be lost and intercepted so that they reach that third party.

Many people judge that what is pleasing to them is also pleasing to others; therefore, explore imprudently what is pleasing or displeasing to them. Address brothers, even those younger than you, with honor and anticipate their respect, as long as they are noble.

Do not provide pleasing things to the point of satiety, lest they become disgusted, but show more than you give, leaving them wanting more. The same applies to games, conversations, etc.

Do not borrow anything from a friend, for if they cannot provide what they have shown, they will hate you, or if they concede reluctantly, or receive incomplete things in return, they will bear it ill.

Do not buy anything from a friend, for if they sell it for a high price, you will be harmed; if they sell it for a low price, they will be harmed.

Treat the least of their servants well, otherwise, they will gradually turn your friend's heart away from you. Observe this in banquets and hospitality. Invent secrets and entrust them as the greatest secrets. Even those things related to their duties, show that you care about them with special attention. If you deal with servants too familiarly, they will despise you; if you act with anger, they will hate you; but if you interact with them with a sweet seriousness, they will respect you.

With well-born people, act with kindness, love, and courtesy; do not admit them to humble services, signs of extreme submission, such as kissing feet. Be indulgent towards the nature of the servants. The shortest way to gain the favor of a prince is to become involved in the prince's more secret affairs, and there is no shorter path to acquiring wealth than the administration of their affairs.

If you seek the favor of the people: promote their advantages with promises that touch upon the individual interests of each; for they are moved by these things more than by honesty.

Accept invitations to dine with the lower classes; do not criticize anything, win everyone over with civility, but maintain your dignity; at least be generous with words.

Be careful not to take away anything from them against their will and add it to yourself.

Show compassion, console them often, and exercise your beneficence towards individuals in parts.

Do not despise anything, but rather praise it.

If it is necessary to contradict, do not accuse them of imprudence or ignorance, but rather praise their reasoning, good intentions, etc., and show the ensuing inconveniences, expenses, etc.

Always show yourself as a defender of the people's immunities. Observe the friend whose favor you want to gain, whether they are dedicated to arms, science, clemency, or truth.

Be a rare intercessor, for whatever is done for others because of you is done for you; but save the complete prince for yourself.

Do not disclose the secret of another; you will be despised by them later. If they command a crime, stall and think about how to excuse yourself, feign illness, stolen horses, etc.

Make friends with the servants of the person whose friendship you seek, even corrupt them with gold if necessary; they will eventually win over their master.

No matter how much you have progressed in favor, hold it as if you were still seeking it through a thousand acts of kindness: for the favor once gained wants to be treated so as not to be lost; indeed, it wants to be treated with more acts of kindness.
