READING SPECULATIVE BOOKS.

What is the assertion, what it teaches, at which points each of the individual words are placed, and indeed in this order, what can be inferred from it, how the assertion can be proven, by which arguments the form of Dialectics can be reduced, and the response can be anticipated, whether the major premise is strong enough, how the minor premise can be confirmed, and which instances can be brought forth, with which Thesis it can agree or seem to fight. What can be objected against, how the text of the art, the paragraphs, and the writing can be explained.

What the opposing opinion brings, in how many points it contradicts, how each individual point can be proven, from which principle, applying the objection, the form, the response to each member, and judging where something is lacking, and what the Opponent can deny, and what can be retorted against; Yourself the objections, which you read, how they can be resolved otherwise, and advanced, in which way some difficulty can be clearer, and by which words it can be presented, and in what it consists, do not immediately apply the conclusion to a specific part, like the physical constitutions, regarding the causes of fire, tree, Angel. For example, theologians on Sacraments in general compared to other Sacraments. Do not be content with having read it once, but with different attempts, the same often does not spontaneously come to the intellect, which could not have been acquired with much labor before, and if someone explains it to you, first read it again yourself, so you may acquire the ability to argue, as Dialecticians call it, supporting the assertion, and against that assertion, or for it; finally, inquire what kind of discourse in the conversation of physicians or doctors can be useful for that speculation.

If you love perfection, join the reading of good authors with experience. Practice is more certain than theory, and books show in a short time what the expense of many years of experience can hardly teach.
