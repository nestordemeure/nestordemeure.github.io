FUNDAMENTUM.

In the past, genuine Philosophy held two principles: Endure and Abstain. Now, there are two new ones: Simulate and Dissimulate. Whether it is Know Yourself or Know Others, these principles (unless I am mistaken) also support the previous ones.
We will first address these; then we will discuss the previous ones in various human actions, and since they occur almost without order, we will present them without particular regard to sequence.
