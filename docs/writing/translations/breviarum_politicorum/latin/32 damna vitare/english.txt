AVOID LOSSES.

Pay attention to even the smallest flaws, and let your agents promptly inform you about any impending damage, so that you do not wait for necessity to arise until it happens. At the same time, let them suggest a method of addressing the issue. The practice of correcting and selling things should be observed; consult with experts about the unknown on a weekly basis. Let the steward give an account of the actions, etc., and let there be one who will bring peace to everyone, inspecting the house to see if everything is closed and what is missing from the home. If you hold any office, report all the given and received items, regardless of how benevolent the Lord may have been, with the utmost candor.
