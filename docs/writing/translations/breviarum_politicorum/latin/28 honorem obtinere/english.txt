STRIVE TO OBTAIN HONOR.

When a dignity is to be conferred and a worthy candidate is sought, portray such a person as you are, describing yourself through the circumstances.
And when it is conferred upon you, pretend not to desire it, feigning contentment with your present status.

Pursue good and clear advice, and see many things that are pleasing to the masses; promote public building assemblies for the poor and those that cannot actually be done by the consent of the subjects.

Do not rely on your talents and merit to obtain any office, as if it necessarily had to be conferred on you, since no one is equally suitable, because they prefer to confer it on the unworthy rather than on those like you: But act as if it had to be obtained solely through the favor of a patron.

Anticipate duties, promise services. Employ intercessors; Do not offer empty opportunities to serve; Diminish yourself, and openly declare yourself unworthy, and give the highest thanks.

If the office you hold requires a powerful person, and no one is more powerful than you, do not allow it to be transferred, and distribute all its revenues perpetually, so that everyone should contribute their strength, not find it, and thus it will remain within your household.

Always striving for the highest is the best, so if you study, study as much as you can, even disregarding the boasting of intellect that some learned people wish to show in their studies. If you seek virtues, achieve them at the highest level of dignity you can, and thus you will be most securely placed in all situations.

Administrations of goods should not be granted permanently, but for a period of three years, so that whoever increases wealth and manages affairs more peacefully may be confirmed in the same office, lest security breed discord. While fortune favors, use it, for it easily flees.

While you are in love, ask for what you can; simulate gentleness, anger, and anticipate rewards with honor.
