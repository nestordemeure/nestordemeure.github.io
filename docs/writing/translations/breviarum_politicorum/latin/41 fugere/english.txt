ESCAPE.

Let aqua fortis be brought to you as if it were burnt wine, with which you can wet your clothes, soak them in straw, retrieve, and suspend them. The guard may believe that you are driven by despair, and with neglected custody, he will spread it to others; seize the opportunity, feign illness so that you appear to have bloody stools by eating madder, feign an altered pulse near your bed by touching it, and fake paleness by eating chalk. From this, request that a doctor be called, complain of suffering from insomnia; request to be transferred to the guard's house, and say that you wish to dine with him; ask for soporifics, which you will give to the host in a drink.

While you prepare your escape in front of your companions, say that you will take flight with a sword so that if any of them were to be interrogated by pursuers, they would throw off the pursuers' hope. Discard a bloodied sword on the road, leave your clothes on the riverbank, so that it appears you threw yourself into the waves, or persuade your companions to retreat to a safer place. Once alone, burn the house where you were alone, as if you had shaken yourself off; have a manageable horse, double your soles with nailed-on shoes, and bring durable consumables.

Never ask about just one route, but several at once, and conceive of a plan with a bystander for the path you least intend to take. Also, when leaving cities or villages, first go out into the fields, change your outfit, cloak, and appearance, then return to the intended path. If those pursuing you are insistent, abandon your injured horse, and when it falls into their hands, they will suspect that you were killed. Let your hat float in a river or well, so they believe you have drowned. Also, have a horse covering, or large saddlebags, whose color you can change when you wish, and a mask made from a membrane with diverse faces painted on both sides, so you can assume them at your discretion.
