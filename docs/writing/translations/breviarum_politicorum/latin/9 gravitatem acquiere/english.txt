ACQUIRE GRAVITY.

Choose suitable occupations, abstain from indecent ones. If you are a Prelate, do not deal with arms; if a Noble, avoid the art of Chiromancy; if a Religious, have Medicine as well; if a Priest, do not be a gladiator. Be easily approachable for those who seek you for business, be patient, and listen to everyone amidst turmoil and confusion.

The seriousness you display at first will soon give way to kindness. For noble minds are often satisfied with the sweetness of words alone, even if they bring nothing, as opposed to being harshly received and alienated.

Do not easily promise or grant; do not easily laugh; do not hastily conclude, and do not change what has been concluded. Do not fix your eyes on another, do not toss your nose, do not frown, do not be sullen. Have few gestures, hold your head upright, use few and meaningful words, do not take overly wide steps, and arrange all your limbs gracefully.

Do not admit to anyone that you love, hate, or fear something. Do not handle trivial matters yourself, but through your servants, and do not talk about them.

When you enter or leave the bed, let no one be present.

Be familiar with few, visit your friends less often, lest you be scorned. Do not initiate conversation in any place without consideration.

Avoid sudden changes in manners, clothing, diet, and splendor, even if for the better.

In praise and criticism, abstain from excessive exaggeration, but judge proportionately to the subject matter, lest you become heavy with too much exaggeration.

Rarely reveal intense emotions, such as pleasures, admirations, etc. Even in intimate friendship, show piety before you; likewise, when acting with the utmost confidence, do not complain about anyone, do not accuse anyone.

Do not order many tasks simultaneously to your subordinates, especially those they cannot carry out, for they will learn to despise orders or be able to demonstrate imprudent commands.

Enact either no laws or very few. Do not easily become angry, for if you are easily appeased afterwards, you will be considered fickle. If you are to speak publicly, prepare beforehand and speak from a written text.
