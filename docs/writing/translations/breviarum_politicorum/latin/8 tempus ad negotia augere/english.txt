TIME TO INCREASE BUSINESS.

There are smaller matters through others.
Prescribe for yourself a strict order that you should not transgress at all, and assign the smallest parts of time to the smallest affairs, and do not linger in any matter longer than is sufficient to properly complete it.

Prudence observes three times at once, and guides its judgments based on the present necessity; past utility or harm; and finally, the anticipation of the future.

If you are tired from business, do not undertake anything further, but refresh yourself with honorable play and physical movement, and you will accomplish more and more easily in a short time afterward, or at least take on such a task to which you can manage without labor.

What affairs can be drawn out over several days, settle them in one day.
Do not admit those affairs that have little profit or glory, and much labor.

Do not undertake useless affairs and those that consume much time for the sake of no one.

Do not deal with craftsmen yourself, nor manage the household affairs, nor gardens, nor buildings; for these are full of labor, and care follows upon care.
