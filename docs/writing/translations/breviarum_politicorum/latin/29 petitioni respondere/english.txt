RESPONDING TO A PETITION.

Do not refuse immediately, but rather engage in discussion; and if you have refused once, do not be fickle, granting only for serious reasons. Before refusing, consider for a while and pretend some distress, either as if you have received a letter or as if some grief has been announced, for which you need to have a discreet servant who, with a sign, will show by gesture and words that you cannot satisfy the petitioner. Praise their request, and if they persist in asking, consider how you can satisfy your affection towards them. Entrust the matter first to a previously instructed servant, so they may carry it out, teaching them the method of doing it and instructing them as if it were their own concern. If you refer the matter to another, so that the petitioner is not left empty-handed, show them the way in which they may approach.

It is the nature of the common people to fly impulsively, soon to languish; so if they ask for something unjust, do not refuse immediately, but rather postpone with brilliant reasons and some favors. If, however, they desire something pleasing, do not delay; they will either give up or turn against you.

Let the hatred of someone be accepted as if it were real, in this they are not false as in love.

If someone cannot be denied a position, grant such a position that brings danger to them and does not disturb the administration of the army; they must be kept in the court with the appearance of honor. Honorary positions must be found so that they can save expenses in granting them, as in the past among the Romans, the praise of the laureate, bracelets, etc. No less will the minds of men be led by these appearances than by actual positions.

Have a fixed time of year, or at least within three years, to review the list of your servants, during which you will remove some from their duties, promote others, distribute positions, and even lend an ear to someone's petition.
Proclaim that if someone has asked for a grant through themselves, it will be denied to them, and if they seek it through others in the future, all will be denied.
