DISSOLVING FRIENDSHIP.

Do not sever a friendship with someone as if with a single stroke, nor with an accepted injury as if with hatred; instead, be reconciled and gradually grow distant with a seemingly fervent love, so that it sweetly dissolves completely. Approach them from time to time, and if the situation calls for it, speak with them briefly as if about business, and invite them to dine so that you appear to be a friend not only when you need them.

If you trust someone because of a patron's goodwill, understand that the patron is a friend who is most affected by that matter, and would be very reluctant, or not willing at all, to grant a favor. Persuade the person asking for the favor to seek it, and when they encounter rejection, exaggerate how such a small matter was denied to them as if it had other implications.

Advise them to ask a friend for a favor in return, which they would probably squander; such as horses for a long journey, clothes for a banquet, or at a time when they themselves will be in need. If the friend agrees, there will be offense, and if not, it will be the same. Or, suggest other matters without a specified time of repayment, so that by reminding or laboring themselves, they feel ashamed to face the other person, and thus the friendship gradually cools.

Spread the word that they live by their friend's advice, that they can accomplish nothing on their own, even go as far as to deny the friend's house, family, and burden. This will make their meetings rarer and dissolve the relationship. Alternatively, make the friend disclose a secret, which in the meantime you can make known to others; in this way, you will make several people distrust the friend's loyalty.
