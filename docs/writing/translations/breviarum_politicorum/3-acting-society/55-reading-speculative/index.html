                <p>When reading an assertion, consider the following: the main message, the number of points made, the specific words used and their order, what can be inferred, and how the assertion is proven.</p>
<p>To internalize the assertion, break down the arguments into a logical structure and anticipate potential responses.</p>
<p>Are the premises sufficiently strong or well-supported?
How can the supporting arguments be confirmed and what examples can be provided?
With what main idea or argument does it agree or seem to conflict?
What objections could be raised against it?
How would the objections explain the core of the text, each paragraph, and the references?
What does the opposing view assert?
On how many points does it disagree with?
How does it prove each point, and from what principle? What are the objections, their form, and the response to each part?</p>
<p>Use this method of analysis to identify weaknesses in the argument. Consider potential counterarguments from adversaries and how they might respond to your own arguments.
Consider the very objections the author rises and how they could be otherwise resolved and advanced.
How could some difficulty be more clearly posed and in what words, and what does it consist of?</p>
<p>Avoid immediately applying the conclusion to specific cases, such as how physicists apply physical causes to phenomena like fire, trees, or angels, or how theologians apply general principles about sacraments to individual sacraments.</p>
<p>Do not be satisfied with reading the text once; revisit and reread the same material multiple times.
Often, what your intellect couldn&rsquo;t grasp despite much effort will occur to you spontaneously later.</p>
<p>If someone explains the text to you, first reread it yourself to develop the ability to argue through each key point and to argue both for and against each assertion.</p>
<p>Finally, consider how this line of reasoning could be useful in discussions with physicians or scholars.</p>
