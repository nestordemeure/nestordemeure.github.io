            <div class="post-content">
                <p>Never assume that someone will keep a secret if you act or speak too freely or confidently in their presence, even if they are a child or servant. They will judge you by this action and describe you accordingly to others.</p>
<p>Never assume that someone will excuse your questionable behavior; in fact, they will likely interpret it in the worst possible way. To prevent this, avoid engaging in any actions that could be seen as questionable, even if there is only one witness.</p>
<p>Do not relate how you were previously defamed or wronged, for you will only defame yourself further and there will be those who approve.
When your actions are questioned, the saying <a href="https://archive.org/details/St.BernardOnTheSongOfSongs/page/n234/mode/1up#:~:text=Excuse%20his,excuse%20the%20act">&ldquo;Excuse the intention even if you cannot excuse the deed&rdquo;</a> does not apply as some may claim that you acted wrongfully by accident, without thought, or that you deliberately sought out evil to test them.</p>
<p>At times, particularly with talkative individuals, you can strategically share a secret, asking them not to reveal it to others. For example, confide that you have significant influence with powerful people or maintain correspondence with them. To support this claim, write letters to these powerful individuals out of sight, seal them, and make a show of destroying the replies you have carelessly kept. However, be cautious with this tactic, as people may distort information they only partially hear.</p>
<p>Boast that you have never harmed anyone and that, if there had to be one thing for which you expect a divine reward, it is this. You can give examples invented on the spot to support your claim.</p>
<p>Whatever is to be made public, no matter how small, do it as perfectly as possible, because often a long-lasting reputation depends on a single act.</p>
<p>Never take on many things at once, because there is no glory in doing many things, only in perfecting one thing. I attest this from experience.</p>
<p>It is always proper and useful to yield to the angry, the powerful, and relatives. Feign humility of mind, candor, generosity, and cheerfulness. Praise, give thanks, and readily offer yourself, even to the undeserving.</p>
<p>The beginnings of any endeavor should be approached with the highest level of advice and effort, and with a strong conviction in their success. The trajectory of the initial stages often determines the course of the entire endeavor, and once achieved, fame can turn even missteps into triumphs.</p>
<p>If there is something you are obligated to do by your office, do not take it on at anyone&rsquo;s request, as it will diminish your commitment to your primary responsibilities. Remember, your reputation will suffer if you neglect your duties even slightly or simply because you took on additional tasks, regardless of your other accomplishments and the distractions you&rsquo;ve managed.</p>
<p>When negotiating affairs, avoid partnering with someone more suitable or experienced than you. When approaching someone, do not bring along a companion who is more well-received or respected. When changing office, do not allow successors who are notably better than you.</p>
<p>Ensure that the honors and achievements of your family or lineage are recorded in print, disregarding any accompanying criticism. Whatever is written with truth and dedication will one day be regarded as plausible. In contrast, spoken words fade with or before the speaker.</p>
<p>You will establish a reputation for knowledge in this way: Compile a small book of historical facts and anecdotes, and reread it monthly during your leisure time. This will help you remember the information, allowing you to demonstrate your knowledge when necessary.</p>
<p>Have many prepared formulas for responding, greeting, speaking, and handling any situation that may arise unexpectedly.</p>
<p>Some individuals debase themselves too much in order to be praised, or so that they may seem to be favored by luck rather than burdened by concerns, and to possess natural talent instead of relying on effort. They begin to neglect and despise themselves, often convincing others to regard them as lazy and feeble. Leave these actions to those dedicated to religious duties.</p>
<p>Never act to the full extent of your power, so that you may be believed to be unable to do anything more.</p>
<p>What you can do, correct, or punish through servants, do not do yourself. You do the greater things.</p>
<p>Do not dispute uncertain things, unless you know you will certainly win.</p>
<p>If you arrange a banquet, share your fortune with the servants of the guests. This is a talkative crowd with significant influence in spreading a bad reputation. A generous gesture should captivate their attention, preventing them from prying into other matters. Similarly, deal generously with barbers and prostitutes.</p>
