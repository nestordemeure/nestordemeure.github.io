A teacher should not teach his student everything he knows, in order to maintain the student&rsquo;s desire to learn more. Similarly, a parent should not give their child so much that the child no longer needs or hopes for anything more from the parent. The same principle applies to a master&rsquo;s relationship with his servant.

                <p>Be generous in giving what you know others will not ask for, or what they will never use, such as privileges.</p>
<p>A teacher should not teach his student everything he knows, in order to maintain the student&rsquo;s desire to learn more.
Similarly, a parent should not give their child so much that the child no longer needs or hopes for anything more from the parent.
The same principle applies to a master&rsquo;s relationship with his servant.</p>
<p>If lands are given, they should be chosen to make the recipient dependent on the giver&rsquo;s goodwill. This can be done by selecting lands lacking essential resources like wood, water, or mills.</p>
<p>If a contract or deed is drawn up, a clause should be included making it revocable at the giver&rsquo;s discretion.</p>
<p>If someone is worthy of a public office and declines your offer, do not allow him to refuse, unless his refusal is made public. Otherwise, people may believe that you did not adequately recognize or reward their merits.
To prevent the person from making excuses, appoint him when the position requires immediate attention, and be absent during this time, so that he is forced to accept the appointment and begin his duties.</p>
<p>Grant favors in a way that costs you nothing. This can be done by forgiving penalties that are due or by not imposing new and unjust taxes, even if your neighbors do so.</p>
<p>The things you use yourself, such as weapons, horses, rings, should not be too costly, so that you can give them away as a great gift at little cost to yourself.</p>
<p>When giving gifts, avoid common methods. For instance, to give a rifle, have a contest with a prize for hitting a target, then give it to the winner as if already victorious. You can certainly decide on the matter, or rig the game.</p>
<p>If you wish to give something pleasing to a particular person, do not promise it in advance, because he may feel obligated to decline it politely or feel indebted to you for the gift.</p>
<p>Those who praise their own possessions in front of others are inviting them to ask for those things.</p>
<p>Avoid hastily criticizing the practices established by your predecessors, as they may have foreseen issues that you have not yet considered<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Likewise, do not readily grant perpetual favors, because it may be necessary to change them later, and you will no longer be able to do so.</p>
<p>Do not appear to throw away gifts, nor try to increase their value so that they may be pleasing.</p>
<p>Consider what needs compel someone to act and when those needs arise.</p>
<p>If you have helped someone, do not mention it to anyone else, as it may offend him and seem like you are reproaching him. And if you are forced to mention it, say it was a debt, and that you do not need or wish to accept thanks for it.</p>
<p>If something is given to you (even if very small), take care not to be ungrateful.</p>
