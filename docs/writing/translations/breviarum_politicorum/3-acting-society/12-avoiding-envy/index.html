                <p>Avoid acting as a witness in disputes. Doing so will inevitably offend one side or the other.</p>
<p>Do not speak poorly of anyone, and do not show disdain through your gestures. If you make a scornful remark about someone, continue the conversation as if nothing happened.</p>
<p>In the presence of others, do not show special favor to anyone. If you do, those who are not favored will feel despised and begin to hate you.</p>
<p>Be cautious of sudden fame or glory, as people can become overwhelmed before they grow accustomed to it.</p>
<p>Do not criticize or condemn the vices or customs that are pleasing to the common people.</p>
<p>If you know the perpetrator of a hateful act, do not expose yourself to new hatred: avoid appearing to approve of the deed, taking glory in it, or mocking those who were harmed. Such actions greatly increase envy. It is better to be absent and remain silent about the deed.</p>
<p>Avoid introducing novelties in your attire, appearance, or the banquets you host.</p>
<p>When making laws, do not imply that some people lack virtue. Instead, compel all to act uniformly.</p>
<p>Provide explanations for your actions to satisfy everyone, but only after you have taken action, to avoid being obstructed or delayed<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Make it a universal principle to speak neither positively nor negatively about anyone, not even a little.
Do not report good or bad deeds, as the person you are speaking to may be a friend of the one you are discussing, and you may inadvertently offend them. Your words, possibly distorted and exaggerated, will eventually reach the person you are speaking about.
If you praise, perhaps the third party who hears will be less of a friend of the praised, and so he will become your enemy.
However, it is better to be well-informed by observing and listening carefully. Be discreet in your inquiries, as people may take offense if they realize you are seeking information about them. Gather knowledge in a way that does not look like you are seeking.</p>
<p>Be cautious of excessive generosity, as it may give the impression that you consider yourself superior to others. Similarly, if you claim to have an abundance of resources or support, it may seem that you do not value or need the help of others.</p>
<p>Avoid boasting that you will enforce the law more strictly and rigidly than your predecessors, as this may alienate friends. Even if you have the right to do so, only propose changes that you know will be well-received.</p>
<p>Do not give any servant authority over others or deal with them in a way that suggests you are acting together, especially if they are disliked.
Do not praise or reward servants unless their virtue is evident to all, as this may encourage others to emulate them.</p>
<p>If it becomes necessary to treat your people with severity, have others carry out the actions. Make it appear as though they are acting independently of your command. This way, if those affected complain, you can minimize the severity and blame those who executed it, as if they were solely responsible.
For example, if discipline is lax, allow others, officials or supervisors, to notice the need for correction and carry out harsh measures without specific instructions from you. They may resort to even harsher actions to avenge themselves, giving you the opportunity to show benevolence to those who appeal to you.</p>
<p>When someone else has earned glory through harsh actions, give them full credit. This way, you will receive the benefits without provoking envy. Doing so can also be seen as a form of glory.</p>
<p>Attribute your good outcomes and successes to the influence, guidance, or advice of others. Act as if you received their support and wisdom.
In success, claim nothing for yourself.</p>
<p>Let your interactions, table, and clothing remain the same. If changes are necessary, make them subtly and gradually.</p>
<p>If someone must be punished, either lead them to confess their own guilt or delegate the judgment to another person. Secretly order this person to pass a harsh sentence, which you can then soften to appear merciful.</p>
<p>Do not insult the vanquished, nor your antagonist, and even if you conquer someone, do not proclaim yourself the victor in deeds or words. Be content with true victory.</p>
<p>If you must make a decision that may provoke envy, use ambiguous language. Present arguments for both sides, emphasizing the one you prefer. However, appear to conclude in favor of the other side or avoid stating a conclusion altogether.</p>
<p>If someone asks you to intercede, promise to do so, but simultaneously indicate that the matter is not entirely within your control and that the outcome may not be favorable.</p>
<p>If vengeance is to be taken through another or an unknown person, order the injured party to grant pardon to the offender, but secretly allow the offender to flee as soon as possible.</p>
<p>If parents are quarreling, do not readily adhere to either side, but find business to be absorbed in, so you may be excused by both sides, and neither will know you are not on their side, even if you show no special friendship to either.</p>
<p>Do not be seen as the author of any new laws, especially adverse ones. Instead, attribute them to your superiors and the ruler.</p>
<p>Be rare in public, readily report trivial matters to your superior, and do not boast of his friendship.</p>
<p>If you notice you can do everything with the powerful, know that whatever sin they commit will be imputed to you. Therefore, ensure the ruler sees your advice, accepts your intercessions, but in your absence arranges the matter otherwise. This should be especially held by confessors of princes.</p>
<p>If your family lineage or ancestors are praised, divert the conversation elsewhere, so they may notice this modesty of yours. Then the praise will be safe without envy. If you seem too pleased, hatreds will arise.</p>
<p>Do not be a public praiser of those things which are pleasing and favorable.</p>
<p>And if it happens that you are removed from office, openly show that a favor has been done for you, a provision for your peace, and seek out reasons to demonstrate this. Thus no one will insult you.</p>
<p>One should not openly inquire who was an enemy or their supporters, nor institute a conversation about it, but it will be in your interest to know everything secretly.</p>
<p>Do not deal openly with those who are hated by all, nor suggest advice to them.</p>
<p>Never let it be known you were in a council in which hated things are believed to be done even against enemies, although you can be the author from afar.</p>
<p>Do not find fault with anyone&rsquo;s deeds, do not criticize or inspect the duties of others. Avoid the places where others preside—such as fields, workshops, or stables—as well as places where they can see that they are being observed. Do not go to these places of your own accord.</p>
<p>Inquire very cautiously from servants and boys about their masters.</p>
<p>See that in your manners, gestures, gait, conversation, play, manner and phrasing of speech, laughter, fervor, there is nothing that can offend.</p>
<p>However you are occupied, if someone approaches, respond most pleasantly and show that he is a welcome guest to you. Excuse him now so he may have another occasion to approach you. To attend to the good of your peace, much will have to be yielded from your comforts.</p>
<p>However much someone tells false and unproven things, listen while he tells it to others. Do not correct him or show that you know better. And do not seem to despise them with jokes and mockery, even to accept them as jokes or so they can notice they are being eluded as vain.</p>
<p>Even if things go badly for some, do not ridicule them. Rather, strive to excuse, entreat, and help.</p>
<p>Do not act toward those not subject to you in ways that seem to be exerting jurisdiction.</p>
