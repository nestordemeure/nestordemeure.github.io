                <p>When presented with a request, do not refuse immediately. Instead, engage in some discussion before refusing. Once you have refused, stand firm in your decision. Only concede for serious reasons.</p>
<p>When you are about to refuse a request, take a moment to consider it, then pretend to be sorrowful.
Alternatively, arrange for letters to be brought to you or have someone announce sad news. To achieve this, instruct a trusted servant to give you a predetermined signal, indicating through gestures and words that you are unable to fulfill the requester&rsquo;s desire.</p>
<p>Praise the requester&rsquo;s request, and if they persist in asking, take time to deliberate how you can demonstrate your affection toward them.</p>
<p>Entrust the requests to a previously instructed servant, teaching the servant how to handle the matter as if it were their own.</p>
<p>If you refer the requester to another person, show the requester how to approach that person to ensure they do not leave empty-handed.</p>
<p>The common people are impulsive by nature. If they ask for something unjust, do not refuse immediately. Instead, put them off with persuasive reasons and some favors. However, if they desire something that benefits you, do not delay in granting it, as their opinion may quickly change.</p>
<p>Allow yourself to accept someone&rsquo;s hatred, as people are more genuine in their hatred than in their love.</p>
<p>If you cannot refuse to grant someone an office, assign them a position that brings danger to themselves without disturbing the administration of the army. Disguise this as an honor, similar to how the Romans retained men in the court with honorary duties.</p>
<p>Establish a set time each year, or at least every three years, to review a written record of your subordinates or employees. During this review, dismiss some from their positions, promote others, distribute rewards or favors, and listen to their requests or concerns.</p>
<p>Announce that if anyone makes a request directly to you, you will grant it. However, if they arrange the request through others, deny it. Announce that in the future, all indirect requests will be denied.</p>
