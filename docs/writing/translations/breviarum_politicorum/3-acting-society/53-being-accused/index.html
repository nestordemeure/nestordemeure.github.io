            <div class="post-content">
                <p>If you notice that someone has accused you, conceal your knowledge of the accusation and do not immediately change your behavior. This way, the informer cannot boast that their accusation was well-received by the Prince or superior they reported to.</p>
<p>Instead, when the opportunity arises, insinuate to the Prince that your accuser is an enemy and an informer. Suggest that informers, like traitors, are useful when needed but should never be truly trusted or loved.
Argue that if he maligns others in your presence, he will do the same to you in the presence of others, and that there is less prudence and harmony among those who are not allies, but rather critics of each other.
Even if the Prince finds such men useful, he will eventually reveal his true feelings towards them.</p>
<p>Approach the person who accused you and consult with them about how to handle the accusation, as if seeking advice from an intimate friend.</p>
<p>In the presence of another, if he has spoken ill of you, trying to turn that person against you, speak favorably about a third person, with whom you are connected, in the presence of the same individual.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the dispute, expose the accuser as a co-conspirator or ensure that the trial is conducted in their presence, especially in matters that are agreeable to you, as was once done in military trials.</p>
<p>If you are accused of multiple offenses, do not deny everything, lest you forfeit all credibility. Acknowledge certain things, even if untrue, to avoid the impression that you are malleable and universally prone to mistakes.</p>
<p>If you know that you have been reported to your superior, it is often beneficial not to clear yourself unless your superior demands it. Defending yourself prematurely may provoke your superior further, so initially avoid doing so as much as possible.</p>
