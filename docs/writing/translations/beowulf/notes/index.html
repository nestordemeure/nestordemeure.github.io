<p>The bulk of the translation work was done using Artificial Intelligence (and in particular <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-family">Claude Opus</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>).</p>
<p>The process and prompt I used are detailed below.
They were born out of a lot of trial and error and are likely still very imperfect (as demonstrated by the fact that I was not able to capture the style I wanted).</p>

    </h2>
</div><p>First, I cut the story into chapters (as a way to both break down the work and introduce breathing points into the reading), starting from <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Carrigan%27s_model_of_Beowulf%27s_Design.svg">Carrigan&rsquo;s model of Beowulf&rsquo;s design</a> then trying to produce units of text of similar size<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> and each ending on a dramatic or suspenseful note:</p>
<ul>
<li>I. Beginnings (from the beginning to the introduction of Grendel)</li>
<li>II. Grendel (from the description of Grendel&rsquo;s action to Beowulf being invited to sit in the hall)</li>
<li>III. Beowulf (from Beowulf&rsquo;s swimming story to the end of the fight with Grendel)</li>
<li>IV. The Morning After (from Grendel&rsquo;s arm cut on the floor to telling us about his mother&rsquo;s existence)</li>
<li>V. Grendel&rsquo;s Mother (from telling us about Grendel&rsquo;s mother to ending with Grendel&rsquo;s head in the hall)</li>
<li>VI. Trophies (from telling us about Grendel&rsquo;s head in the hall to telling us about the existence of the dragon)</li>
<li>VII. The Dragon (from telling us about the dragon to Beowulf being deadly wounded)</li>
<li>VIII. Twilight (the end)</li>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>I edited this translation, removing all Christian references (such as &ldquo;Cain&rdquo; and &ldquo;Almighty God&rdquo;), and making sure that the chapters started and ended where I wanted.
I also added notes to highlight parts of the text and elements I care for in order to ensure that they survive the next step.</p>

        <a class="heading-anchor" href="#style" style="text-decoration: none">
            Style
        </a>
    </h2>
</div><p>I used the following prompt to transcribe the text into the style I wanted<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-md" data-lang="md"><span style="display:flex;"><span>I have provided you with a literal translation of the first chapter of Beowulf, titled &#34;Beginnings,&#34; which covers the story from the start up to the introduction of Grendel. The translation includes annotations in square brackets to highlight key elements and aspects that I find particularly important or compelling. Please note that Christian vocabulary has been deliberately minimized or removed.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>Your task is to rewrite this chapter, focusing on enhancing the style while preserving the story&#39;s content and details. We will tackle the remaining chapters in subsequent tasks. As you edit, please prioritize the following three aspects:
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">1.</span> <span style="font-weight:bold">**Clarity**</span>: 
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>   <span style="color:#66d9ef">-</span> Employ simple, direct language, avoiding archaisms.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>   <span style="color:#66d9ef">-</span> Use a straightforward vocabulary that is easily understood.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>   <span style="color:#66d9ef">-</span> Craft simple sentence structures to enhance readability.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>   <span style="color:#66d9ef">-</span> Organize the text into concise paragraphs, merging or splitting them as necessary for better flow and comprehension.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">2.</span> <span style="font-weight:bold">**Vividness**</span>:
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>   <span style="color:#66d9ef">-</span> Recognize that Beowulf is composed of vivid, dramatic scenes designed to shock and captivate the reader&#39;s imagination. Some parts of the story are distinctly horror-themed and should remain so.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>   <span style="color:#66d9ef">-</span> Engage all senses in your descriptions, just as the original text does:
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>     <span style="color:#66d9ef">-</span> Visual elements: Preserve details such as engravings on objects and other small, evocative details.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>     <span style="color:#66d9ef">-</span> Auditory elements: Highlight mentions of music or its absence, as well as other significant sounds.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>     <span style="color:#66d9ef">-</span> Tactile elements: Incorporate descriptions of weight, strength, temperature, and other physical sensations.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>   <span style="color:#66d9ef">-</span> Maintain and emphasize the recurring visual motifs present in the story, such as blood red (gore), gold and yellow hues, shadows, ice, fire, etc. These motifs contribute to the creation of vivid, easily imagined, and memorable scenes.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">3.</span> <span style="font-weight:bold">**Orality**</span>:
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>   <span style="color:#66d9ef">-</span> Bear in mind that Beowulf is an oral story narrated by a storyteller who addresses the audience directly (akin to Rudyard Kipling&#39;s style in &#34;Just So Stories&#34;). Preserve and enhance the narrator&#39;s first-person voice through phrases like &#34;who I heard,&#34; &#34;Let me tell you,&#34; etc.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>   <span style="color:#66d9ef">-</span> Identify and restore repetitions and motifs in the language that serve as landmarks for the narrator and the audience to follow along, such as &#34;That was a good king!&#34;, &#34;That was a good people!&#34;, &#34;Son of,&#34; etc. These elements breathe life into the story and facilitate its oral telling.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>Your goal is to enhance the style and flow of the chapter while staying true to the original intentions and meaning. This is a modern restoration aimed at making the story&#39;s content clear and engaging. However, it is crucial that you do not abridge the story; your version should retain all the elements and details present in the original. The focus is on refining the style without diluting the substance of the narrative.

            Final Notes
        </a>
    </h3>
</div><p>I obtained a serviceable translation of Beowulf into prose<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>.
It, however, fails at capturing the style I wanted, the orality of the poem.
Fixing it will be for another day.</p>
<div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes">
<hr>
<ol>
<li id="fn:1">
<p>Mostly because it boasts both a very long context length (giving it the ability to read and write long texts such as Beowulf) and best-in-class abilities when it comes to literary writing. Sadly, and likely not coincidentally, it is much weaker than alternatives like <a href="https://openai.com/gpt-4">GPT-4</a> at following instructions.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:2">
<p><code>Trophies</code> might be worth splitting further (when Beowulf leaves), but I am not quite sure that the splitting point would be able to sustain a reader&rsquo;s interest.&#160;<a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:3">
<p>This prompt was written by Claude. It took an earlier prompt I wrote (of similar complexity) and cleaned it up.&#160;<a href="#fnref:3" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:4">
<p>Hard to say how much of the quality of the end result comes from the model being able to read Old English and how much of it comes from Beowulf being a classic text.&#160;<a href="#fnref:4" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
