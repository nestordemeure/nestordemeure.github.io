            <div class="post-content">
                <p>Beowulf has been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_translations_of_Beowulf">translated</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_adaptations_of_Beowulf">adapted</a> many times. I believe this stems from the impossibility of producing a perfect translation—a translation that would both preserve the form (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliterative_verse">alliterative verse</a>) and produce a text whose meaning is clear to modern readers (is the text even designed to be read silently?). This produces many compromises, as well as axes of freedom, for the translator.</p>
<p>The following is a list of takes on the text that I find of interest:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/147453272-beowulf"><em>Beowulf: A New Verse Translation</em> by Seamus Heaney</a> This has become the de facto classic translation of Beowulf by which all others are weighed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374110031/beowulfanewtranslation"><em>Beowulf: A New Translation</em> by Maria Dahvana Headley</a> This translation (and in particular <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/08/27/906423831/bro-this-is-not-the-beowulf-you-think-you-know">this review</a>) is the text that got me interested in Beowulf. I love the concept, the boldness of the vision, and the belief that one should engage with the text, but I stand by my belief that there are better executions of similar ideas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57429810-beowulf"><em>Beowulf</em> by Meghan Purvis</a> This is poetry. Splitting Beowulf into different stories and voices, breathing a lot of life and humanity into the text (see also <a href="https://www.pennedinthemargins.co.uk/index.php/2013/06/meghan-purvis-on-translating-beowulf/">her essay on translating Beowulf</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/676737.Grendel"><em>Grendel</em> by John Gardner</a> This tells the tale from an existentialist Grendel&rsquo;s perspective. One could hardly think of a more modern take on an ancient story.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/291858"><em>Beowulf: The Script Book</em> by Neil Gaiman &amp; Roger Avary</a> Peering into other mediums, this contains two versions (the original as well as the one actually used for the movie) of the screenplay Neil Gaiman wrote for the <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0442933/">2007 Beowulf movie</a> (which was also turned into a graphic novel).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23198296-beowulf"><em>Beowulf: A Translation and Commentary</em> by J.R.R. Tolkien</a> The gold here is Tolkien&rsquo;s commentary. His essay <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beowulf:_The_Monsters_and_the_Critics">Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics</a> has been transformative for the text and its interpretations, opening the way for a new wave of thinking on the topic.</p>
