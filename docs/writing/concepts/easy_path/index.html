<p>The opposite of wanting something to be perfect is following <a href="https://nestordemeure.github.io/writing/concepts/easy_path">the easy path</a>: knowing that some things could be done to make your project objectively better but keeping with the current version because it is <em>&ldquo;good enough&rdquo;</em>.</p>
<p>The main solution to fight the easy path is to have other people take a look at your work and give you constructive feedback.
As they do not have to work to implement the modifications they are suggesting, they will be naturally immune to the easy path.
You might still try and resist tooth and nails but, as soon as two independent observers have pointed that a modification seems needed, there is no defending your choice, you are in the minority.</p>
