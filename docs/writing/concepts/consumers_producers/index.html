            <div class="post-content">
                <p>Most activities can be categorized as either <strong>consumer</strong> or <strong>producer</strong>.</p>
<p>A <em>consumer</em> activity is an activity during which you consume existing content such as watching a video, reading a book, or browsing the Internet.
Depending on the content you consumed, it can be nourishing or leave you with a feeling of having wasted your time.</p>
<p>A <em>producer</em> activity is an activity during which you produce new content for others to consume such as drawing, writing, cooking, or programming.
It is creative and gives you a feeling of accomplishement but requires time, focus, and practice.</p>
<p>Once you start labeling your activities, you are likely to realize that you are heavily biased toward consumer activities.
That realization can make you feel guilty about wasting your life (which can then push you to consume further content to feel better, a vicious cycle) but being biased toward consumer activities is perfectly okay and normal.</p>
<p>Consumer activities are <em>necessary</em>. You cannot produce if you are not nourished by the things you have consumed and they soothe you after a day of work or focus.
You should <em>not</em> try to remove consumer activities from your life, but you can aim for balance.
This is the point of classifying activities.</p>
<p>You can now take note of how much time you invest into each type of activity and <em>consciously</em> push it toward your preferred ratio of consuming and producing.</p>
