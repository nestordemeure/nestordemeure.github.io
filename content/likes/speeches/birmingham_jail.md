> *"I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to "order" than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice."*
â€” Martin Luther King Jr., Letter from a Birmingham Jail

[Letter from a Birmingham Jail](https://www.africa.upenn.edu/Articles_Gen/Letter_Birmingham.html) speaks to me because it is addressed to me.
I *am* the white moderate who takes the absence of tension over justice for others.

Inside me is something that wants *comfort* and would rather have it than go out in the street for a cause that is not directly mine.

I am working on it.
