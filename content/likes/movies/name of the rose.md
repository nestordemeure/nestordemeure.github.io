***Note: There will be spoilers.***

I just re(re-re)-watched [the Name of the Rose](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091605/) and I still absolutely love it.

The main character, William *of Baskerville*, is basically a Sherlock Holmes clone (he even says "Elementary!" to his apprentice a couple of times) except that he is a Franciscan monk living during the middle-ages and investigating a murder in an abbey that is busy with a debate on whether the church should be poor.
As far as I am concerned, this is the perfect set-up for a movie.

The murder mystery aspect is impeccable, with a really clever murder weapon (a killing book!) and a perfect setting, an abbey hiding a labyrinthine library that contains thousands of volumes thought to be lost (you *want* to explore this abbey).
Sean Connery is excellent in the role of William of Baskerville, a man of great intelligence, love for knowledge (he is not lying when he says that he fell in love... with books) but also inexpugnable vanity (he goes as far as falling into a trap set in front of a mirror!).
Vanity that will catch him back later when, in his quest to prove that he is right, he will be the indirect cause of the burning of the library he so loves (his tears, when he realizes the consequences of his actions in the burning building, are heartbreaking).

But, while our attention is directed to the murder mystery, the question of church and riches is asked several times.
Explicitly, it is the object of the religious debate happening in the abbey, but also by showing us a large variety of religious groups illustrating diverse positions:

* the Franciscans who made a vow of poverty,
* the pope's emissaries, dressed opulently and exploiting the people (their carriage is *pushed* by peasants until their reach the abbey's gate),
* the Benedictines, extracting riches from peasant and fattening themselves but living in relatively austere conditions (the golden cross worn by the abbot is one of the few visible signs of luxury)
* the heretics who killed priests as a reaction to their greed (an *active* vow of poverty, by opposition to the Franciscans[^1] who, despite their best wishes, [let inequalities happen and preach inaction](https://www.africa.upenn.edu/Articles_Gen/Letter_Birmingham.html#:~:text=I%20have%20almost,presence%20of%20justice)).

The priests debate whether Christ owned his robe and kill over books while the peasants live in mud, ready to do anything for food.
The church is fully detached from them, they pay taxes, are used as labor and feed scraps, but they have literally no voice in the debate: *no peasant speaks during the movie*, ever[^2].
We are left with the indistinct feeling that peasants are uneducated brutes that have to be lead by others, for their own good[^3].

Overall it is a great murder mystery that also manage to demonstrate a deep love for books and intellectually stimulating quests[^4] while asking whether this is really what we should be thinking about when people are suffering not that far away from us...

[^1]: They can also be seen as opposed to the inquisition.
The heretics don't *really* care about poverty (something said by the main character and showed as both heretic do not hesitate to exploit peasants) but they do want to change the status quo.
Meanwhile, the inquisition *also* kills people and does not care about money, but they only care about *preserving* the status quo.

[^2]: As the title of the movie reminds us, the narrator leaves without even knowing the name of the peasant girl he fell in love with.

[^3]: And then they effectively revolt and kill the inquisitor. Showing us that they are perfectly able to take the matter in their own hand. But, still, this feels like a background action, something that has less importance to our narrator than the burning of the library or his romantic feelings.

[^4]: A lot of the charm of the movie is inherited from the source material, the [excellent and eponym book by Umberto Eco](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/119073.The_Name_of_the_Rose).
