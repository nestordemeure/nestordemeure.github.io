I watched [Guillermo Del Toro's Nightmare Alley](https://youtu.be/Q81Yf46Oj3s) yesterday and... It was ok.

I might have been let down a little because I love both Guillermo Del Toro and the source material (by the way, you can find both the original [black&white movie](https://archive.org/details/nightmarealley1947) and the [book](https://archive.org/details/nightmarealley00will/mode/2up) for free, legally, on the internet archive) so I had a lot of expectations.

The actors are solid, the movie has a very nice forties ambiance (I love the psychologist's office design) and some scene are wonderful (the one scene dealing with the consequence of his actions... and the final scene which was already one of the strong points from the original story) but I felt that the scenario was lacking. In particular it gets very very linear and unsurprising once they get out of the carnival (also, I believe all the parts on the main character's father could have been omited, I suspect it hinders more than it adds to the story).

Overall, it is nice but a little disapointing. Probably still worth watching if you loved the original or the director.
