*Astrology SOS*, by *The Woke Mystix*, is not about telling you what your zodiac sign (there is already a plethora of books about the subject out there) does but rather to give you a sense of *rhythm*.

Our rhythms[^quarter_life] as well as the rhythm of the weeks, seasons[^winter], planets, etc. It is not about woo[^woo], it is about keeping your hear to the flow of life and seasons. Being aware of the flow to be able to take actions[^action] instead of being a cork raised by the tide.

If I had a criticism to make of the book, it is that it tells you what various events mean and how to deal with them but does not provide you with an easy tool to know if they are happening (when is Saturn in retrograde? I have no idea, I am not a weird astrology person[^person]).
*Let's fix it!* Here are a few celestial events happening right now and what they mean according to the book:

[^quarter_life]: You will find the quarter-life crisis under the heading *Saturn's Return*.

[^winter]: Winter depression can be found under the heading *Winter Solstice*.

[^woo]: Even if it *does* own its woo vibes.

[^action]: The books gives you readings, warnings as well as small rituals. But you will probably want to do your own things.

[^person]: Am I?

It's a time when past lovers or friends might resurface, providing opportunities for closure or rekindling, but caution is advised in starting new relationships or reigniting old flames until after the retrograde. Embrace self-care rituals like creating a sensual bath or building a goddess altar to honor your divine feminine energy, regardless of gender. Reflect on the patterns in your past relationships and envision the kind of partner you wish to become and attract in the future. Venus retrograde is also a period for financial prudence; instead of impulsive spending, focus on cultivating a sense of abundance in various aspects of life, beyond just material wealth.

It's less about outward chaos and more about inner reflection, encouraging us to reassess what we're truly passionate about and what might just be a product of societal or familial expectations. During Jupiter Retrograde, it's common to experience what may seem like misfortunes, but these moments are often opportunities for a much-needed shift in perspective. This period is ideal for tapping into our intuition and exploring our life's purpose with honesty and clarity.

It’s an opportunity to redefine success, not by material gains, but by alignment with our true purpose.

This is a time for social consciousness, to become more aware of collective needs and to find your role in driving positive change. It's crucial to stay flexible and open to new experiences, using this period as an opportunity for self-discovery and liberation.

It's a period where endings and beginnings intertwine, pushing us to let go of what no longer serves our growth. This retrograde period is particularly powerful for addressing issues related to power dynamics, subconscious influences, and reconnecting with our inner child. It's a transformative phase that, while challenging, offers profound opportunities for personal evolution and understanding the deeper layers of our psyche. As Pluto eventually goes direct, the insights and growth achieved during this time can lead to significant, positive changes in our path and a deeper alignment with our soul's purpose.
