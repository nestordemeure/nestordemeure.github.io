## December

### Love
As the month gets going, get ready for some tremendous sparks to fly. You may even surprise yourself with the excitement you cause. This is genuinely one of those times when things just seem to click into place, and your good feelings rub off on everyone around you -- most of all, the lucky guy or girl who gets to reap the benefits!

### Finance
Some months, everything in your financial life just seems to go right. Unfortunately, this doesn't look to be one of those months. Play things close to your vest, and you'll be able to ride out the challenges of this difficult period. Better luck is surely around the corner, probably by sometime next month.

### Health
No news is good news on the health front, and lucky for you, that's just what you can expect the entirety of this month. You've generally been taking good care of yourself, and as long as you keep it up, you shouldn't have any problem keeping the doctor away.

### Leisure
Even though you've got business to take care of, there's some rejuvenating R and R in store for you this month. Fun comes in many forms, guises, and budget levels, and as long as you bear that in mind, you should have plenty of opportunities for lots of it throughout the month -- so don't skip out on them!

## January

### Love
You can expect some frustrations in the romance department this month. You might find yourself feeling like you're having trouble connecting with someone. While this is bound to be dissatisfying, remember that not everything is in your control, and this too will pass.

### Finance
Good news: beneficial things await your pocketbook. If you've been working toward some sort of payoff, you can expect to start reaping the rewards this month. And if you haven't, then prepare yourself for a pleasant monetary surprise! Whether or not you've seen this bit of success coming your way, you certainly deserve it, so enjoy it.

### Wellness
You've been taking pretty good care of yourself lately, so your good sense of all-around well-being should come as no surprise. Stay with it and you'll continue to feel generally perky and in tip-top shape health-wise, and it's sure to spill over into other areas of your life too.

### Recreation
Unfortunately, the stars don't show a whole lot of leisure time in store for you this month. Despite your best efforts, you'll feel like you can never quite get caught up. This is natural for Pisces this month. Don't let it get you down, and hold out for improvements next month.

## February

### Love
This month you're a romantic force to be dealt with, and you're loving every delicious minute of it! You've taken some important steps on the right course lately, and the groundwork you've laid will have you ready for the feast of love that's coming your way. Remember to use your best judgement, and some incredible times will be yours.

### Finance
You've been enjoying some monetary success, and the good news is, there's more where it came from. Things are looking up for you financially, and as long as you keep making those wise decisions and being smart about your finances, there's no reason they should take a downturn.

### Health
Things definitely stand a chance of getting a little bumpy with your physical wellness this month. Don't be surprised to find yourself down and out for a bit. But above all, make sure you don't worsen things by ignoring them. Taking care of yourself is the key to recovery.

### Leisure
This looks to be an excellent month for an exciting little adventure with someone close to you. You finally have the opportunity to let your hair down and have some fun, so take advantage of it. Even if you don't manage a major excursion, recreation will be a key point for you this month.
