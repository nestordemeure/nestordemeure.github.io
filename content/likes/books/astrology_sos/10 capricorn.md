## December

### Romance
Whether your love life has been warm or cold lately, the coming month will see things heating up for you. You've made some personal progress lately, and it will pay off for you and a very lucky guy or girl! You know when you've got it good, so enjoy yourself with that special friend.

### Money
You're feeling pretty flush this month -- enough so that you're able to spread the good cheer around a little bit. By all means, make the most of your good fortune, but don't start spending foolishly; it's always better to be prepared for the unexpected than to get caught short.

### Health
Unfortunately, this doesn't look to be an outstanding month for you health-wise. Nothing too serious, but you're likely to find yourself feeling more than a little worse for wear in one way or another, and it might not be an easy thing to shake. Take the time to treat yourself well, and you'll be rewarded.

### Recreation
You can expect to find yourself pretty well tied up for most of this month. Important business beckons, and taking care of it will be worth sacrificing some of your usual leisure activities. This may not sound like a whole lot of fun, but in the end it will prove to be worth it.

## January

### Romance
It's time to saddle up for a for a wild, love-filled month. The sparks will be flying hot and heavy between you and someone lucky, so be careful not to set off the fire alarm and sprinklers! This is the perfect month to just go with the flow, and enjoy the easy, effortless way you connect with your special friend.

### Money
You know worthwhile efforts are never easy, but this month financial matters may seem even more difficult than you had bargained for. Even if it's a bit of a tight month, it's important to stay focused and keep your wits about you.

### Health
Things could get a little rocky this month as far as your health is concerned. It might be a new development or an old problem creeping back, but either way you're likely to have at least a few days of feeling down and out. Rest and the proper care will make sure it's as few days as possible.

### Recreation
You'll be looking at plenty of chances for little adventures this month, whether they're far away or something quick and close to home. Remember that "vacation" doesn't have to mean "costly and time consuming," and you'll be set for a month full of leisurely fun.

## February

### Romance
Whether it's a specific setback or a general sense of distance, there's a good chance you'll find yourself lacking a feeling of real closeness with anyone this month. Use this as a time to reflect on what you really want out of your love life, out of a potential romantic partner, and out of yourself.

### Money
Unfortunately, it looks like you might be feeling a little pinch in the pocketbook this month. If you find yourself coming up shorter than you expected a time or two, don't panic. Just hold tight, and avoid making any rash decisions. Use your best judgement, and things should start to smooth out sometime next month.
