## December

### Love
Even if your love life has led to some frustrations lately, these next few weeks will see your situation getting much, much warmer. The positive steps you make will naturally take you (and a very lucky guy or girl!) to whole new places. You know when you've got it good, so go out and enjoy yourself and that special friend.

### Finance
It looks like things are finally starting to go your way financially this month. The steps you've taken are yielding some very positive results, and you'll be seeing the payoff in the form of some positive cash flow. Stay smart about it, and you'll continue to reap the rewards.

### Health
Things could get a little rocky for you on the health front this month. Not terrible, but serious enough to require some professional attention and care -- this isn't the month to try to sort out the problem yourself (or even worse, ignore it altogether).

### Recreation
Remember, a vacation doesn't have to be a long trip to a far away place; a quick adventure close to home can be just as refreshing, and you'll have the chance for plenty of those this month. Bear that in mind, and you'll be set for a month full of leisurely fun.

## January

### Love
Get ready for a rambunctious, romance-filled month! There's a veritable truckload of mutual attraction between you and someone lucky, and it's going to set off some major sparks. You'll both want to mark off some time in your calendars to make the most of this love-fest, and by month's end, you'll be glad you did.

### Finance
Any worthwhile effort takes time, but this month your effort could take longer than usual to yield a positive result, and leave you with a frustrating amount of "month left over at the end of the money." You might have to tighten your belt, but keep your wits about you and you'll avoid any major blunders.

### Health
If you happen to see your doctor this month, he'll commend you for taking good care of yourself, while secretly grumbling behind your back for not giving him anything to bill you for! Keep up the good work and your health will continue to be on the up-and-up.

### Recreation
Even if you have to get creative with the financial end of things, you'll still find plenty of ways to get out there and have a little fun this month. There are lots of leisurely, entertaining activities that won't break the bank, and if you look, you won't have any problem finding them.

## February

### Love
Does Cupid's arrow just seem to be missing your heart this month? If so, don't dwell on the negative. Instead, take this opportunity to think about what you really want out of your love life, and consider what you can do to make it happen -- and bring this unlucky streak to an end!

### Finance
You're feeling pretty flush this month -- enough so that you're able to spread the good cheer around a little bit. By all means, make the most of your good fortune, but don't start spending foolishly; it's always better to be prepared for the unexpected than to get caught short.

### Health
Your good sense of all-around well-being should come as no surprise, since you've been taking quite good care of yourself lately. Stay with it and you'll continue to feel in tip-top shape health-wise, and it's sure to spill over into other areas of your life too.

### Recreation
You can expect to find yourself pretty well tied up for most of this month. Important business beckons, and taking care of it will be worth sacrificing some of your usual leisure activities. This may not sound like a whole lot of fun, but in the end it will prove to be well worth it.
