## December

### Love
Unfortunately, you can expect some pot holes on the road to love this month. While keeping your eyes peeled will naturally help you dodge a few of them, you're bound to hit some of them head on. While this is sure to be frustrating, remember it's up to you to change your circumstances if things aren't going the way you know you deserve.

### Money
You'll find yourself on a bit of a roll financially this month. Even if things have been a little lean lately, you can expect to catch a break that will go a long way toward easing your monetary worries. Be sure to stay wise and make the most of it.

### Health
This month you may experience some setbacks with your well-being that are beyond your control. Be attuned to what your body is telling you, and remember it's not as resilient as it was when you were a teenager! Take steps to right whatever is ailing you, rather than just letting it go.

### Recreation
You have the means and opportunity to make your leisure time quite enjoyable this month -- and that's enough of a motive all by itself! Plenty of chances for fun are yours for the taking, so go ahead and take. By month's end, you (and the people close to you) will be glad you did.

## January

### Love
You're feeling a real romantic connection with someone special this month. Whether it's a hot new flame or an established relationship, the sparks between the two of you are sure to be flying fast and furious. You'll be loving every minute of it, and so will your lucky partner.

### Money
Unfortunately, it looks like you might be feeling a little pinch in the pocketbook this month. If you find yourself coming up shorter than you expected a time or two, don't panic. Just hold tight, and avoid making any rash decisions. Use your best judgement, and things should start to smooth out sometime next month.

### Health
Have you been eating your apple a day? It seems like it, because no worries about your well-being await you this month. Pay attention to your body and keep treating yourself right, and you should continue to feel healthy and have plenty of energy for the important stuff.

### Recreation
You've got quite a bit on your plate at the moment, and taking care of some genuinely important business might have to take precedence over fun outings this month. Be prepared to make the most of the little bit of leisure time you do have.

## February

### Love
Things might seem a little slow for you in the romance department this month. This is bound to be frustrating, but look for the silver lining. A little space to yourself could turn out to be just what you need to figure out what you really want, and how best to achieve it.

### Money
You'll be seeing green this month, and it won't be because of jealousy! Your financial situation is looking good, and you should find yourself feeling pretty flush -- enough to spread the wealth around a little bit, if you're so inclined. Think about how to parlay your success into something even better.

### Health
There are months when you're feeling great, the picture of perfect health... and then there are months like this one. You'll be facing some difficulties this month, but they don't have to get the best of you -- especially if you're smart about taking care of yourself, and keep a positive attitude.

### Recreation
The stars don't show a whole lot of leisure time in store for you this month. Despite your best efforts, you'll feel like you can never quite get caught up. This is natural for Virgos this month. Don't let it get you down, and hold out for improvements next month.
