## December

### Love
If you detect a whiff of something sweet in the air, it's because romance is in full bloom for you this month. Your charms have been working, and someone special is really taking notice of you. You feel like you deserve a little sweetness in your life, and you know what? You're right! So enjoy it for all it's worth.

### Money
Although you're certainly not greedy, there's a certain comfort that comes with financial security. And lucky for you, you've got that in spades this month. If you've been having money worries, they'll quickly get sorted out, leaving you with peace of mind and a little left over to spend too!

### Health
Things could get complicated with your health this month. Not emergency-room complicated, but enough to interfere with other areas of your life in ways you don't need, unless you take steps to remedy the situation. Take those steps, and you'll keep the problem down to a minimum.

### Leisure
You'll have some time to kick back and relax this month, and you should definitely take advantage of it. Taking a couple days or nights (or both) to show yourself and someone close to you a good time will have just the sort of energizing effect you've been looking for.

## January

### Love
A certain someone is showing a good deal of interest in you lately, and you're loving every minute of it. In fact, you'd almost let it go to your head if you were less humble. But don't let that modesty get in the way of all the enjoyment you'll be getting from this guy or girl's company. You've earned it, so don't be afraid to make it count.

### Money
Leos traditionally find this to be a tough month financially, so you might want to be prepared to tighten the old belt a little and cut back on a few things. Your natural perseverance will get you through until things start to pick up for you again, probably by next month.

### Health
If you're looking to play hooky from work or school this month, you'd better be a good actor, because your health will give you no excuse! Unless you count the slight possibility of a brief sniffle, nothing will interfere with your wellness.

### Leisure
Despite any other problems that may crop up, you'll have ample opportunity for recreation this month. Getting out of the house and doing something you enjoy is a great way to clear your head and let you see things from a new perspective -- and that can help you out in all aspects of your life.

## February

### Love
You may find yourself feeling a little bit solitary and disconnected this month, as something that seemed sure and comfortable turns out to be not quite what you expected. There may be a lesson or two to be learned from this challenging time, to take a few moments to reflect on your own needs and actions.

### Money
Your finances are treating you pretty well this month. Projects that you've had in the works will finally start to show results, and you'll find yourself solidly in the black (maybe even with a little left over to spare). Stay cautious, and keep working to insure your good fortune doesn't turn out to be a fluke.

### Health
Either you or someone close to you has been taking good care of you, and your body is reaping the rewards; you're the picture of good health all through this month. Keep it up, but at the same time, use that energy to deal with things that might need more of your attention.

### Leisure
Unfortunately, you can expect recreation and free time to come at a high premium this month. You might find that despite what you'd prefer, you have to be a little bit of a hermit in order to get things taken care of. This isn't a crime, and those close to you will understand.
