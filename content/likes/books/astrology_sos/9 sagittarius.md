## December

### Romance
Has your romance cup just not been running over lately? If not, don't dwell on the negative. Instead, take this opportunity to think about what you really want out of your love life, and consider what you can do to make it happen -- and bring this unlucky streak to an end!

### Money
Make sure the kitchen knives are sharpened, because you're eating steak this month! Things are going your way, and you'll likely find your wallet a little thicker and heavier than usual. Take this opportunity to plan your next move, so the advances you've made can keep on giving.

### Health
You're in for an uneventful month on the health front -- and we mean that in the best possible way. Keep taking good care of yourself like you've been doing, and you shouldn't have any problem keeping the doctor away.

### Leisure
Keep your eyes open for the opportunities for excitement in store for you this month, because there will be lots of them. Even if you've been busy lately, the groundwork you've laid will open up the possibility for a marvelous, fun filled break or two, so enjoy it!

## January

### Romance
Good news: that special guy or girl you've been daydreaming about has been dreaming about you too. So don't be shy! Whenever you take charge of the situation and grab the reins, you're sure to see some of those dreams transform into magnificent real life events. By month's end you'll thank yourself for it (and you won't be the only one).

### Money
Even if things have been a little tight in the financial department lately, this month you can expect some good news. The vision you've been pursuing is finally paying off, and you'll start to see some tangible, positive results. Stay on top of things, but at the same time, enjoy your success.

### Health
If you have any health concerns at all this month, they should be very minor -- a sniffle here or a bruise there, but nothing more serious than that. Otherwise, your body is well-tuned and ready to go, so get out there and make the most of it.

### Leisure
Your lack of free time this month might be frustrating, and justifiably so, but it's important not to let yourself get too negative about it. Enjoy the knowledge that with some good judgement and responsible decisions, this challenging time will give way to a more positive situation by next month's end.

## February

### Romance
Wow -- this is your hunka hunka burnin' love month! In spite of your busy life, you'll experience more than a few excitement-filled moments with a charming guy or girl. Be sure not to let negativity from the past get in the way of the opportunities you have now, and this will be a month worth remembering.

### Money
This month you're on a streak that will have you hearing the sound of cash registers ringing. But luck is only a fairly small part of the answer -- most of this success is down to your hard work finally beginning to pay off like you've known it should. Keep up the good work, and your success will continue to grow.

### Health
It might take more than an apple a day to keep the doctor away this month. Some health challenges are coming your way at some point, and they might be nothing to sneeze at. To keep the disruption as minor as possible, pay attention to your body and tend to little problems before they get big.

### Leisure
With all that you've got going on, it's no wonder your opportunities for recreation will suffer a little bit this month. But remember, it's a small -- and temporary -- price to pay. Keep on top of the important stuff this month, and by the end of next month you'll be able to start relaxing.
