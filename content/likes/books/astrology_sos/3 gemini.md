## December

### Love
You've been musing about you and a particularly outstanding guy or girl, and lucky you, they're musing right back. So don't be shy! Whenever you take charge of the situation and grab the reins, you're sure to see some of those dreams transform into magnificent real life events. By month's end you'll thank yourself for it (and you won't be the only one).

### Finance
Even if things have been a little tight in the financial department lately, this month you can expect some good news. The vision you've been pursuing is finally paying off, and you'll start to see some tangible, positive results. Stay on top of things, but at the same time, enjoy your success.

### Health
It looks like you're headed for a rough patch with your health some time this month, so take care of your body and do what you can to minimize it in advance: Once the problem arrives, don't wait for it to go away on its own; the longer you wait, the more you'll wish you hadn't.

### Leisure
This month should offer plenty of chances for you to put your feet up and get in some recreation and relaxation. Taking some time to enjoy life with someone close to you will provide exactly the sort of refreshment you've been looking for, and help you keep things in perspective.

## January

### Love
Wow -- this is absolutely your hunka hunka burnin' love month! In spite of your busy life, you'll experience more than a few excitement-filled moments with a charming guy or girl. Be sure not to let negativity from the past get in the way of the opportunities you have now, and this will be a month worth remembering.

### Finance
Make sure the kitchen knives are sharpened, because you're eating steak this month! Things are going your way, and you'll likely find your wallet a little thicker and heavier than usual. Take this opportunity to plan your next move, so the advances you've made can keep on giving.

### Health
Get ready for your close-up, because this month you could be the poster boy or girl for good health. No obstacles await your well-being in the near future. Furthermore, if you treat yourself as well as you have been, you could extend this healthy streak for some time to come.

### Recreation
Even if you have to get creative with the financial end of things, you'll still find plenty of ways to get out there and have a little fun this month. There are lots of leisurely, entertaining activities that won't break the bank, and if you look, you won't have any problem finding them.

## February

### Love
This month you'll find yourself passing time with a guy or girl who makes you feel beautiful, worthwhile, and mainly marvelous. So even if circumstances beyond your control make you testy a time or two, keep that 1,000-watt smile turned on -- you're going to light some lucky soul's heart on fire with it.

### Finance
You'll hear the sound of cash registers ringing this month as you experience a monetary lucky streak. But luck is only a fairly small part of the answer -- most of this success is down to your hard work finally beginning to pay off like you've known it should. Keep up the good work, and your success will continue to grow.

### Health
Your health will require more attention than usual this month. Whether it's a new problem or an old difficulty coming back to haunt you, you'll want to make sure you seek out the right kind of care. Be vigilant, and don't put off dealing with the matter.

### Leisure
Keep your eyes open for the opportunities for excitement in store for you this month, because there will be lots of them. Even if you've been busy lately, the groundwork you've laid will open up the possibility for a marvelous, fun filled break or two, so enjoy it!
