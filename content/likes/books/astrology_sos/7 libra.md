## December

### Love
Lucky for you, it seems like there's romance everywhere you turn this month. Someone is going out of their way to make you feel special, beautiful, and all-around fabulous -- and they're doing a darn good job of it! Let them know you appreciate it; a little positive reinforcement can go a long way!

### Money
Good news: beneficial things await your pocketbook. If you've been working toward some sort of payoff, you can expect to start reaping the rewards this month. And if you haven't, then prepare yourself for a pleasant monetary surprise! Whether or not you've seen this bit of success coming your way, you certainly deserve it, so enjoy it.

### Wellness
This looks to be a fairly breezy month with no complications for you, health-wise. Of course the stars can't give you an iron-clad guarantee that you won't have so much as a sniffle or a bruise, but indications are that on the whole you're in good shape, with all systems go.

### Leisure
The good fortune you've had in other areas may mean you have to give up some of your free time this month, but don't despair. The groundwork you're laying now is what will allow you to kick your feet up and relax once things settle down a bit. Keeping your nose to the grindstone this month will pay off soon.

## January

### Love
Get ready for some amazing sparks to fly this month. You may even surprise yourself with the excitement you cause. This is genuinely one of those times when things just seem to click into place, and your good feelings rub off on everyone around you -- most of all, the lucky guy or girl who gets to reap the benefits!

### Money
You've been enjoying some monetary success, and the good news is, there's more where it came from. Things are looking up for you financially, and as long as you keep making those wise decisions and being smart about your finances, there's no reason they should take a downturn.

### Wellness
Things definitely stand a chance of getting a little bumpy with your physical health this month. Don't be surprised to find yourself down and out for a bit. But above all, make sure you don't worsen things by ignoring them. Taking care of yourself is the key to recovery.

### Leisure
This looks to be an excellent month for an exciting little adventure with someone close to you. You finally have the opportunity to let your hair down and have some fun, so take advantage of it. Even if you don't manage a major excursion, recreation will be a key point for you this month.

## February

### Love
You know what you need out of romance, and lucky you, you've got someone who's happy to deliver! Thus month will be a bona fide feast of love for you and the current Mr. or Ms. Right. Try to keep your head on your shoulders throughout all this excitement, but at the same time, you owe it to yourself to make the most of it.

### Money
Some months, everything in your financial life just seems to go right. Unfortunately, this doesn't look to be one of those months. Play things close to your vest, and you'll be able to ride out the challenges of this difficult period. Better luck is surely around the corner, probably by next month.

### Health
Have you been eating your apple a day? It seems like it, because no worries about your well-being await you this month. Pay attention to your body and keep treating yourself right, and you should continue to feel healthy and have plenty of energy for the important stuff.

### Recreation
You've got quite a bit on your plate at the moment, and taking care of some genuinely important business might have to take precedence over fun outings this month. Be prepared to make the most of the little bit of leisure time you do have.
