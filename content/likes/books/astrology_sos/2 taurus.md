## December

### Love
Unfortunately, this is a month looks to be a challenging one for your love life. You've been feeling more than a little far away (in many ways), but don't worry, this won't last much longer. Keep your chin up, and hold out for when your situation gets better by the end of next month.

### Finance
This is one of those months when all your financial dealings just seem to click into place, and you come out ahead with hardly any effort. This doesn't mean you should go on a reckless spending spree, if there's something you've had your eye on for a while, go ahead and splurge -- you've earned it.

### Health
You can expect to run into some complications this month. Nothing too severe, but serious enough that if you don't see a doctor, you'll end up wishing you had. Nipping the problem in the bud is the best way to make sure it doesn't get worse than it needs to, so don't procrastinate.

### Recreation
While you could stand to catch up on some R&R, unfortunately this doesn't look to be a good month for it. You're busy being responsible and taking care of important things at home or at work, which doesn't leave much time for fun and games. This is a good month to keep your eyes on the prize.

## January

### Love
Romance is in the air for you this month, and if there's someone you'd especially like to draw closer to you, the odds are you just might. Your misgivings will melt away as you find your very own inner flirt, and your special friend -- or friend-to-be -- is going to love it.

### Finance
Challenges await you in the money department this month, but don't fret, they may seem worse than they really are. This turn of events will be frustrating, but with some creative thinking, you'll be able to keep it from turning disastrous. Stay focused and think things through before you act.

### Health
Unfortunately this looks to be a somewhat challenging month for you, health-wise. The stars indicate some problems that aren't life-threatening, but are more than a mere nuisance to be ridden out. Paying attention to your body and making sure you seek the right care is the surest way to set things right.

### Recreation
Some months are for cutting loose and having fun, and some months are for laying the groundwork that will let you cut loose in the future. This month is one of the latter. Fortunately, while months like these aren't very exciting, they don't have to be negative either. Remember, months like these make the more adventuresome times possible.

## February

### Love
This has traditionally been a difficult month in the love lives of most Taurans. Whether it's a specific setback or a general sense of distance, you're likely to find yourself lacking a feeling of real closeness with anyone. Instead of getting frustrated, use this as a time to reflect on your real romantic goals and how to achieve them.

### Finance
This month you might join the ranks of those who think money is the root of all evil -- or at least, the root of all frustrations. Just remember that problems can lead to opportunities, and with good judgement this could turn out to be a window that let you effect a much-needed transformation.

### Health
Some trials await you in the health department this month. If you don't have a physician that you see regularly, this would be a good time to ask around and find one, because some of these problems aren't the kind that go away on their own. A positive attitude will help speed your recovery.

### Recreation
Your lack of free time this month might be frustrating, and justifiably so, but it's important not to let yourself get too negative about it. Enjoy the knowledge that with some good judgement and responsible decisions, this challenging time will give way to a more positive situation by next month's end.
