## December

### Romance
Unfortunately, the stars indicate a lull in your love life this month. Despite your best efforts, you'll probably find it frustratingly difficult to make the kind of romantic connection you'd like. Remember this too shall pass, and don't let yourself settle for something that you'll end up regretting later on.

### Money
Your finances are treating you pretty well this month. Projects that you've had in the works will finally start to show results, and you'll find yourself solidly in the black (maybe even with a little left over to spare). Stay cautious, and keep working to insure your good fortune doesn't turn out to be a fluke.

### Wellness
There are months when you're feeling great, the picture of perfect health... and then there are months like this one. You'll be facing some difficulties this month, but they don't have to get the best of you -- especially if you're smart about taking care of yourself, and keep a positive attitude.

### Recreation
Whatever other problems may exist, the stars indicate that leisure will be easy and abundant for you this month. Plenty of chances for fun are yours for the taking, so go ahead and take. Doing so will help you maintain a level head, and keep you focused and energized for dealing with other matters.

## January

### Romance
You've definitely grabbed the interest of a certain special someone lately, and you can look forward to spending this month enjoying it to the hilt. In fact, you'd almost let it give you an ego if you were less modest. But don't let that humility get in the way of all the pleasure you'll be getting from this guy or girl's company.

### Money
Financially this isn't shaping up to be a stellar for you, and you might find yourself having to cut back on a few things. This is to be expected for Pisces at this time of the year, although that doesn't make it any less frustrating. Stay focused and keep your wits about you, and you'll be able to hang through this challenging time.

### Wellness
If your doctor is the sensitive type, he might start to worry that you don't like him anymore -- because he won't be hearing from you this month! Nothing but good health awaits you as the weeks pass. Enjoy your well-being, and use it to your best advantage.

### Recreation
The stars say there's some leisurely fun in store for you this month. Although you're busy, you'll still find plenty of time to kick back, relax, and enjoy yourself. Doing so will give you a renewed perspective, and help generate some positive ideas.

## February

### Romance
You can expect things to be running a little slow in your love life this month. This is bound to be a little disheartening, but look for the silver lining. A little space to yourself could turn out to be just what you need to figure out what you really want, and how best to achieve it.

### Money
You'll find yourself on a bit of a roll financially this month. Even if things have been a little lean lately, you can expect to catch a break that will go a long way toward easing your monetary worries. Be sure to stay wise and make the most of it.

### Wellness
No need to worry about your health this month, as everything seems to be doing exactly what it should be. Your good habits have been paying off in the form of a clean bill of health. As long as you keep them up, you should continue to reap the rewards.

### Leisure
Although you've got important things to tend to, there's some rejuvenating recreation in store for you this month. Fun comes in many forms, guises, and budget levels, and as long as you bear that in mind, you should have plenty of opportunities for lots of it throughout the month -- so don't skip out on them!
