## December

### Romance
Your charms have been working overtime lately, and lucky for you, it hasn't been for nothing; someone special is taking extra notice of you. How you take advantage of that is up to you, but be sure to make the most of it. You feel like you deserve a little loving care in your life, and you know what? You're right! So enjoy it for all it's worth.

### Money
Aquarians traditionally find this to be a tough month financially, so you might want to be prepared to tighten the old belt a little and cut back on a few things. Your natural perseverance will get you through until things start to pick up for you again, probably by next month.

### Wellness
If you have any health concerns at all this month, they should be very minor -- a sniffle here or a bruise there, but nothing more serious than that. Otherwise, your body is well-tuned and ready to go, so get out there and make the most of it.

### Leisure
This looks to be a good month for you to catch up on some much need R&R, be it near by or far away. Whatever challenges exist in your life, you'll have ample opportunity to set them aside for a little while and enjoy yourself. Treat yourself to an adventuresome outing; it will do you tremendous good.

## January

### Romance
You may find yourself feeling a little bit solitary and disconnected this month, as something that seemed sure and comfortable turns out to be not quite what you expected. There may be a lesson or two to be learned from this challenging time, to take a few moments to reflect on your own needs and actions.

### Money
This is shaping up to be a tricky month for you financially. Some things that you thought were in the bank turn out not to be quite as sure as they seemed, and you'll find yourself feeling a bit of a pinch because of it. No major disasters, but you might need to tighten your belt a notch or two until next month.

### Wellness
Some trials await you in the health department this month. If you don't have a physician that you see regularly, this would be a good time to ask around and find one, because some of these problems aren't the kind that go away on their own. A positive attitude will help speed your recovery.

### Recreation
Your lack of free time this month might be frustrating, and justifiably so, but it's important not to let yourself get too negative about it. Enjoy the knowledge that with some good judgement and responsible decisions, this challenging time will give way to a more positive situation by next month's end.

## February

### Romance
Unfortunately, you can expect some pot holes on the road to love this month. While keeping your eyes peeled will naturally help you dodge a few of them, you're bound to hit some of them head on. While this is sure to be frustrating, remember it's up to you to change your circumstances if things aren't going the way you know you deserve.

### Money
It looks like things are finally starting to go your way financially this month. The steps you've taken are yielding some very positive results, and you'll be seeing the payoff in the form of some positive cash flow. Stay smart about it, and you'll continue to reap the benefits.

### Wellness
Your medicine cabinet is going to be feeling neglected this month! Bad for it, but great for you as you experience a breezy month free from concerns about your health. That means you'll be able to focus your attention where it's needed -- so get to it!

### Leisure
Unfortunately, you can expect recreation and free time to come at a high premium this month. You might find that despite what you'd prefer, you have to be a little bit of a hermit in order to get things taken care of. This isn't a crime, and those close to you will understand.
