## December

### Love
Some frustrations are in the picture for you in the romance department this month. You'll probably find yourself feeling like you're having trouble connecting with someone. While this is bound to be dissatisfying, remember that not everything is in your control, and this too is temporary.

### Money
Your financial dealings will really click into place this month, and with a little effort you should come out ahead of the game. Don't let it go to your head, but do go ahead and reward yourself -- sensibly! -- for your success. After all, there's no point in earning it if you can't enjoy it a little.

### Health
Your health will be more of a concern for you than you're used to this month. You can expect an issue that requires attention, even if it seems like just a minor nuisance at first. The surest way to let little issues fester into nasty complications is to ignore them, so take care of yourself and don't fall into that trap.

### Recreation
With so many different things going on in your life, leisure time will come at a high premium this month. You've got a lot of irons in the fire, and tending to them all won't leave you with a lot of time left over for R&R. So this is a good month to keep your eyes on the prize.

## January

### Love
This is shaping up to be a romance-filled month, and if there's someone you've got your heart set on getting closer to, chances are you just might. Your hangups will disappear as you find your very own inner flirt, and a very special guy or girl is going to be loving every minute of it.

### Health
Your health will require some looking after this month, so be prepared to put the needed time and effort into taking care of yourself. If you don't, something that starts as a mere nuisance could turn into a more serious problem as the days go by. Don't let that happen, and you'll be back on top before too long.

### Recreation
This is looking like one of those busy months, where you the groundwork that will let you cut loose and have fun in the future. Which means it probably won't be terribly exciting, but it doesn't have to be negative either. Remember, months like these make the more adventuresome times possible.
