## What is it about?

The Owl House is about a young girl living her dream of moving to a world of witches.

The target public is mostly younger children (up to high school).

## Why do I like it?

This is basically a cartoon version of Harry Potter with great representation (strong women, people of color / diverse ethnicities and wholesome LGBTQ+ relationships) and a strong *"be your own quircky self"* message.

One strength of the show is that, while it is plot focused, the plot goes *fast* losing no time.
Very often something starts and, as you start thinking that they will wait for the end of the season to resolve it, it is dealt with in one or two episodes at most.

## Some downsides

It tries to be more serious than similar shows (such as Amphibia) which translate into less comedy and a colder art style.
