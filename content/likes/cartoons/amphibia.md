## What is it about?

Amphibia is about a young girl being trapped in a world of talking frogs, adapting to her new environment and trying to get back home.

The target public is mostly younger children (no older than middle school).

## Why do I like it?

The show is made of bite-sized, mostly self-contained adventures.
It is very light-hearted[^consequences], you can pick up any episode and go along with the comedy and adventure of the day.

[^consequences]: I would consider it a comedy first and an adventure show second. Few things have a lasting impact in this world, a character can fall off a cliff and be fine in the next moment.

## Some downsides

Each episode is a thinly veiled lesson that the main character has to learn to grow as a person (getting her from a mostly helpless kid in the first episode to a strong independent and realized woman in the last) and it sometimes feels like the main character is learning the same lesson again and again.

Compared to the first seasons (in which the character might be fighting tomatoes to cook a dish), the last season is a bit overwhelming in scope (going into anime-like powers and having the main character meet a god-like figure and save the multiverse).
I believe that they manage to stick the landing but it could have been significantly smoother[^gravity].

[^gravity]: See *Gravity Falls* for a cartoon that does a similar transition (and was likely their inspiration) but manages to get things pretty much perfect.
