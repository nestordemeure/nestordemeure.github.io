## What is it about?

We follow the adventure of Harley Quinn, Joker's previous sidekick and girlfriend (in the Batman universe) as she becomes an independent villain with her own crew and a healthy love life.

The target public is teenagers to adults.

## Why do I like it?

This show is both very funny and very good at character development[^adventure].

With time, the Batman universe has accumulated a lot of unhealthy behaviors[^unhealthy].
Most takes on the universe decide to ignore those problems (sidestepping them or accepting the mythology at face value), but this show decides to deal with them head-on and get everyone back to healthy relationships and worldviews[^joker]. 

Overall, it is a very refreshing take on the Batman universe.

[^adventure]: Here violence and adventure are *occasions for the characters to grow*, not the main focus of the show.

[^unhealthy]: The relationship between the Joker and Harley Quinn, as it is depicted in the comics, is *not* healthy. Batman himself could do with some therapy to finally deal with the death of his parents.

[^joker]: Including the Joker. And a healthy Joker is no small feat...

## Some downsides

Blood. Blood everywhere. The show decided to make gratuitous violence a part of their esthetic (which makes sense given the primary character) so if (admittedly cartoon) blood is a turnoff for you, you might want to skip this show.
