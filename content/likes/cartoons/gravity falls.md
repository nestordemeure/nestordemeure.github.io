## What is it about?

We follow twins during their summer vacation with their weird old uncle.

The target public is mostly younger children (no older than middle school).

## Why do I like it?

This is twin peaks for kids.

This show strikes a great balance between being funny, mysterious, adventurous, quaint, somewhat a coming-of-age story and still funny[^funny].
All of the plots work well together and it juggles between tones seamlessly.

This is the *one* show that managed to transition into a larger plot in their final season and stick the landing perfectly.

[^funny]: I suspect the key here is that they never take themselves too seriously. The characters might try to be serious but, for the writers, having fun with their material goes before everything else.

## Some downsides

They have been an inspiration to a lot of cartoons but, they made their final look so easy that a lot of other shows tried and failed to reproduce the magic of that final season.
