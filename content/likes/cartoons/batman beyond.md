## What is it about?

The events of the cartoon happen years in the future, Bruce Wayne is now a grumpy old man mentoring a young new Batman.

The target public is middle school to high school children.

## Why do I like it?

Batman Beyond is a Peter Parker (Spiderman) like teenager dressed as Batman and evolving in Blade Runner's dystopian company-owned universe and it works *so* well.

The universe is dark (and looks beautiful) but the main character's sense of humor and his great alchemy with old Bruce Wayne make up for it.

Overall it is a very good action focussed cartoon.

## Some downsides

Apparently, ethics committees are not a thing in the future.
In this universe, a _lot_ of things can give you both trauma and superpowers.
