Figures of speech (which you can find [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8zdPz7y5Pwnymik5D7rgI5fTEB__4P1z)) is a project done [illuminations media for the Almeida Theater](https://www.illuminationsmedia.co.uk/productions/figures-of-speech/) in which great actors read great speeches and it is absolutely fantastic.

It includes, amongst others, Ian McKellen reading Harvey Milk's *Hope Speech*, Derek Jacobi reading Socrates' *I Go To Die*, and Noma Dumezweni reading Margaret Sanger's *The Morality of Birth Control*.

The actors are great, the speeches have stood the test of time and it is a great vessel to get familiar with them.
