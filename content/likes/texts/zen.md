> *One day a famous government officer met a highly respected elderly master. Being conceited, he wanted to prove that he was the superior person.*
> 
> *As their conversation drew on, he asked the master, "Old monk, do you know what I think of you and the things you said?"*
> 
> *The master replied, "I don't care what you think of me. You are entitled to have your own opinion."*
> 
> *The officer snorted, "Well, I will tell you what I think anyway. In my eyes, you are just like a pile of dry shit!"*
> 
> *The master simply smiled and stayed quiet.*
> 
> *Seeing that his insult had fallen on deaf ears, he asked curiously, "And what do you think of me?"*
> 
> *The master said, "In my eyes, you are just like the Buddha."*
> 
> *Hearing this remark, the officer left happily and bragged to his wife about the incident.*
> 
> *His wife said to him, "You conceited fool! When a person has a heart like a pile of dry shit, he sees everyone in that light. The elderly master has a heart like that of the Buddha, and that is why in his eyes, everyone, including you, is like the Buddha!"*
