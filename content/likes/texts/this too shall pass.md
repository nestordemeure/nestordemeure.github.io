> *"King Solomon once searched for a cure against depression.
> He assembled his wise men together.
> They meditated for a long time and gave him the following advice:
> Make yourself a ring and have thereon engraved the words 'This too will pass.'  
> The King carried out the advice.
> He had the ring made and wore it constantly.
> Every time he felt sad and depressed, he looked at the ring, whereon his mood would change and he would feel cheerful"*

This version of the story is closest to the one I was taught, I find it comforting during hard times, reminding me that they are only temporary.

However it has several variants, in both [Jewish](https://ohr.edu/ask_db/ask_main.php/335/Q1/) and [Persian](https://sufi-teachings.tumblr.com/post/97070241755/the-story-behind-this-too-shall-pass-persian) folklore, and they are unanimous on the fact that *the sentence works both ways*, having the power to remove a smile from a happy man's face.
