Martin Niemöller was a German Lutheran pastor active when the Nazis rose to power.
Being a conservative, he applauded Hitler's election, finally someone who would *make Germany great again*.

It took the Nazis threatening the church for him to realize that something was not right and start fighting back.

Interestingly, in 1968 a member of the US congress used a modified version of the poem in which he replaced the *"communists"* with the *"industrialists"*.
This is particularly ironic because the original poem lists victims of Nazism while the industrialists have both hugely profited from Nazism and actively helped to put Hitler in power...
