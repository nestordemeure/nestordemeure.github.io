> *"Back in my religious days if you independently rediscovered an idea already uncovered by some rabbi 400 years ago it was a big deal and great honor, the whole class would celebrate you. The bigger the rabbi the greater the honor."*

I think that this is a very *healthy* approach toward the rediscovery of ideas.
Honoring both the lineage of knowledge and the ability to reach a particular conclusion instead of lamenting the fact that we do not get to reap the benefits of being the first to climb a particular hill.

Recognizing the value in the act of having an idea is also a healthy reminder for people afraid of having their ideas stolen: *the apple does not fall far from the tree*, you will have further good ideas while someone copying your result will have to work backward from that particular conclusion[^seed].

[^seed]: Furthermore, an idea is only a seed. Execution and dissemination are where most of the value is found, without their multiplying effect a great idea is of little value.
