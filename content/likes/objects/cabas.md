If you do your groceries on foot[^1], a shopping trolley bag (with wheels) is a game-changer.

The main hurdle when going grocery shopping on foot is dealing with the weight of the produces on the way back.
However, I observed a large number of old people doing their groceries on foot as if it were nothing (while the way back was clearly strenuous to my weak arms).

Their superpower? The power of the *wheel*!
If you put your produces in a trolley bag, you can carry the heaviest objects (I am talking yogurt, bottles of olive oil, and packs of milk all at the same time) as if they were nothing!

Try it, it costs almost nothing, lasts years, and will make your groceries so much easier.

[^1]: Which you probably should if your grocery store is within a walking distance. A car might be justified to deal with the weight, but a trolley bag solves that problem.
