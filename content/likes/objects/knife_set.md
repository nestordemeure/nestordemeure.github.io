I am usually against knife sets; they tend to contain useless knives and suboptimal versions of useful knives, but I absolutely love this set of paring knives[^vict].

[^vict]: I have also [heard good things about their chef's knife and bread knife](https://youtu.be/wd9uoHsWuOE), apparently similarly great value and sturdiness for the price, but I have yet to test them.

For [$22](https://www.victorinox.com/en-US/Products/Cutlery/Paring-Knives/Swiss-Classic-Paring-Knife-Set-3-Pieces/p/6.7116.32), it includes a small (paring) knife (useful whenever you want a small sharp knife, i.e., perfect for onion), a serrated slightly longer (tomato) knife (great for smooth vegetables, like tomatoes, as well as a surprising array of small bread, sandwich, and pastries), and a small serrated knife (the least useful of the set, usually used when one of the other two is in washing).

The knives are useful; I use at least one whenever I am cooking, they handle well thanks to their small size and handle design, and they stay sharp with no real effort[^sharp].

[^sharp]: You do have to follow the basics of *knife care*: handwash your knives (no dishwasher), use them on soft surfaces (never ceramic or stone), do not use them on harder things than they can handle (no bone or steel wire), and [sharpen](https://youtu.be/7a0pQT1kVS0) the small paring knife every few months.
