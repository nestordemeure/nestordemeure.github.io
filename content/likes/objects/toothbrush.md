The Philips Sonicare toothbrush is the best electronic toothbrush I ever used. By a significant margin.
It is not only good at cleaning your teeth but also one of those rare objects that are well *designed*.

Regarding the quality of the cleaning (arguably the most important criteria), I could feel a sensible reduction in plaque when I went from a traditional toothbrush to an electric toothbrush, but this was one more step.
After brushing with an electric toothbrush, I used to be able to feel that there was some plaque left but switching to a Philips Sonicare *fully eliminated that sensation*.

But that is only the tip of the iceberg.
Most electric toothbrushes have an integrated timer. It beeps or vibrates at regular intervals to help you give your brushing the proper amount of time and attention.
However, most of them beep once per minute which is useless to me: it is simply too long to be used as a marker.
The Sonicare beeps every twenty seconds, the time needed to clean a sixth of your month.
That is perfect as it is regular enough to help me guide the brushing while ensuring I spend exactly two minutes brushing[^1].

Also, the glass provided with the brush (if you bought an edition that includes a glass, I highly recommend doing so) shows *actual _care_ put into design and user experience.
Usually, the mix of water and toothpaste left on the brush at the end of brushing trickle down to the base making it very unappetizing after even a week of use.
That base requires regular cleaning while being the part of the brush that is plugged into the wall, it is somewhat of a pain to deal with.
The Sonicare toothbrush rests in a glass with a round bottom.
Not only you can clean the glass easily (it is not plugged) but the liquid trickles to the middle of the glass staying there with no contact with the base and making the overall brush cleaner.

On the minus side, the brush lets you know when you should buy new toothbrush heads, but they are somewhat pricey.

[^1]: Knowing that you brush in exactly two minutes is powerful because you *know* that brushing will be fast.
It encourages you to brush regularly, two minutes is too short to justify cutting because you are in a hurry.
