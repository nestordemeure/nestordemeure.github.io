In the past, two fundamental principles dominated philosophy: *Sustain* and *Abstain*.
However, new principles have since emerged, namely *Simulate* and *Dissimulate*, and, complementing them, *Learn About Yourself* and *Learn About Others*.

We will first address *Learn About Yourself* and *Learn About Others*.
Then, since human *Actions* do not follow a particular order, we will explore the principles of *Simulate and Dissimulate* in various contexts.
