Pay attention, lest there be a deficiency or excess in food, both in quantity and quality, in clothing, etc. concerning warmth and cold. The difficulties of sleeplessness in labor, in a place where the air is not too high, should be praised. The sources of diseases, movement, and rest should be moderate due to repletion and evacuation; the passions of the mind should not be unbridled. Do not dwell near swamps or, indeed, even rivers.
The windows of the bedroom should face the North wind from the East rather than the South. In serious matters, do not focus for more than two hours; but occasionally let there be relaxation of the mind; let the food be well prepared and available everywhere.
Use Venus (i.e., engage in sexual activity) moderately, whatever your state, and according to the needs of your own constitution.
