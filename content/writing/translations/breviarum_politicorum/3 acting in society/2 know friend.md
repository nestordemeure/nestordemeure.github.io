Dare to question someone, if the other remains silent, he will not be a friend, or if he diverts the matter elsewhere, or speaks weakly and reluctantly, if he diminishes the other's praises, if he says he cannot be consistent with himself, or if he shifts the praise onto others; Likewise, if he is aware of a praiseworthy deed, when you mention it, he adds nothing that could criticize it. Also, if he claims the event to be a mere coincidence or attributes it to the excessive Providence of God, and exalts others as having done equal or greater things, or that it was done by someone else's counsel. Write letters in the friend's name to him, in which he asks for something to be entrusted to him, his inclination or opposition will be revealed. Greet him in the friend's name, or say that you have heard something unfavorable about him, and you will see what he adds to these things.
