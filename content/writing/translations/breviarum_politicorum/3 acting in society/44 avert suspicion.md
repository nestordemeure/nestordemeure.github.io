Read the titles: Acquire Favor, Avoid Offense, Act Cautiously.
If you are suspected of having slandered some accusers in the presence of the Prince, write a letter to the same person containing praises, and send it so that they may fall under suspicion. Or, if you wish to harass them, allow the letters written inside to be intercepted by various artifices; they will suspect that they can be read by water or fire. Alternatively, write only the first and last syllables of each sentence, and openly implore that you do not want these letters to reach the Prince's hands, lest you appear to be a flatterer.
