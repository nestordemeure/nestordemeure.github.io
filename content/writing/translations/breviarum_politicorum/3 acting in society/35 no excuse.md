Tell them that you will satisfy their petition or excuse, when not consulting for their better good. Leave letters that will be read after a certain day of your departure, meanwhile announcing their duty to all. If they write letters to you, do not respond to them. If they plead in person, say that they are simply in this position for a short time, and they will be freed soon if it seems appropriate; they should accumulate their merits to counteract others' envy. For this duty is only entrusted to those who are to be promoted to greater things, whose virtue is evident.
