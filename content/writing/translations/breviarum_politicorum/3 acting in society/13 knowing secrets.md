Invite even lowly people to conversation, treating them with kindness, especially if they are won over by the touch of gold, they will reveal everything (the same can be achieved through children, but with risk involved). Allow servants to interact with each other, so that they disclose each other's secrets. To everyone, however, maintain loyalty faithfully, so they do not lose confidence; and do not use the acquired knowledge immediately, but wait for the right opportunity.
