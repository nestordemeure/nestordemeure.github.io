If false attitudes are held in public for too long, they eventually become apparent; hence it is better to abstain from the limelight and entice others who truly have such emotions to do the same. It is best to distract yourself with leisure in the meantime, so that you forget about the very emotions you want to read in others, thus no one, no matter how closely they observe, will be able to discern anger or joy from you.
