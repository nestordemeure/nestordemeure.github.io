If you deposit something with someone by betting on the outcome of some matter, at the same time deposit an equal amount with another person on the opposite outcome of the same matter, and thus you lose nothing.

In burdensome contracts for yourself, add undetermined conditions, which can be more broadly and strictly explained, for example, having surrendered the city, you will keep everything safe if no disturbance arises; do not add publicly, whether privately from your own or others, if it is necessary, and if the fairness of the matter demands it; you will reject the agreements. In promises, if you do this or that to my satisfaction, etc., it will be easy to show a deficiency.
