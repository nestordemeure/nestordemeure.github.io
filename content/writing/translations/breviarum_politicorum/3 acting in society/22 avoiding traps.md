Pretend to quarrel with a false friend so that they suspect a genuine dispute, revealing their intentions and wanting to use it to their advantage. Then suddenly, with their strength bound, avoid and resist them in the future. This will also work against robbers lying in wait on the road or in other places where you know there are traps. When traps are set against you, flee and lead them into their own traps.
And if they are set by someone powerful, disguise your words so that they do not burst into open force, but seek a middle way in your responses, so that you neither fall into their snares nor show that you have noticed their deceit.

If someone tries to involve you in an action that would harm you, show your willingness to do it wholeheartedly, and prepare for it unless there is a difficulty in arranging the means. In the meantime, turn your attention to something different from the matter at hand.
