Also, if they act more passionately than usual, or more relaxed, they are not acting on their own; or if they suddenly change their opinion and show fervor, it is a sign of having accepted bribes. If they do not accept well-refuted reasons, they do not act in those ways. Also, if they present arguments that are overly elaborate, subtle, sought after, against nature, or trivial, and yet passionately pursue the cause.

Send someone who, under the guise of friendship, deals with them and confidently demands the cause, then they will reveal everything else.
