Do not exercise cruelty with your own hand, beware of striking, if it is necessary to punish well and serious cases are lacking, it will be prepared in this way. If you can forgive a child and are accustomed to punishing lightly, he will bear it unworthily, he will begin to complain and grumble, to be punished again, and to complain again, then as if stubborn, the guilty of a grave offense will pay greater penalties for greater offenses. Sometimes young people are more inflamed by punishment, so they should be allowed certain things, but such things that satisfy their desires, not to go on to other things, that is, not needing other things to achieve them, nor to attract similar things.

If you remove someone from your house, court, or office, and it affects others badly, spread and publicly grieve, finally noticing, that you are inclined by him to the public damage of the subjects, and those who watch his downfall, from now on, their affairs are in a better place, but let each be able to suffice for all to confirm this, do things that make faith, as if you have removed the manager through whom they stood, who would be paid less in wages, and immediately take care to pay.

Administer justice generously in another's skin, where your loss is not incurred, so if your Governor oppresses the subjects, let him urge the gratitude to be repaid (if public affairs require it) so that they write them down to be demanded again, at least voluntarily binding themselves to some burden.

If you want to correct someone, deliberate with him about the remedies, he will find nothing more pleasing than what he himself has discovered, likewise, he will impose the penalty on himself. Be an enemy in inquiry, dissemble when you can without harming another, and abstain from insults towards the well-born, give him letters to be carried to your certain agent, secretly press other commendatory ones, which contain his punishment.

If you want to bring someone to a better way of life, put him in office, so that he corrects in others the error he himself struggles with, for example, a drunkard should exact punishment from other drunkards.

If someone humbles himself enough and openly, spare him so that you do not drive him into worse things out of desperation, nor force him to do what he would most refuse as guilty, be content with moderate vengeance. After the decree of a moderate punishment, it should be expected, if perhaps a new life arises. When you approach the guilty, do not show them that you have removed the way for them, so that they may not acquire anger by not hearing any crimes, show yourself born indeed for mercy.
