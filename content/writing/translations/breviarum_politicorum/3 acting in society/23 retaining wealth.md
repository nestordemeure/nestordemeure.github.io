Do not despise small gifts, and avoid wasteful expenses. Do not be generous with even the smallest things, such as bread, food, or horse feed, so that they are not poorly managed. Consult with good economists, and learn industry from them. Consider what can be sold from your lands, what can be planted, and what can be developed, and employ workers accordingly.

Know your entire income and always keep an eye on it.

If you are going to make expenditures, think first about how you can recover an equal amount so that nothing is lost. For example, if someone decides to give four thousand shields to brave soldiers, first impose monetary penalties for gamblers and similar vices so that the generosity can be reimbursed.

Do not keep valuable items that lose their use or value. Instead, have only what is precisely sufficient for your status, such as silver vessels in which craftsmanship is valued more than the price itself. If a necessity arises, they will be of little help to you.

You will detect the deceptions of a steward in this way: after he has given an account as if he had forgotten, order him to repeat the same information after a few hours from memory. If the information is false, it will be inconsistent.
