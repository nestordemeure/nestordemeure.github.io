Full trust should not always be given to prudent men,
because they downplay the matters concerning their privileges;
And because they interpret others' reputation too favorably; they will not admit if someone has spoken ill of you in their presence, nor who should be guarded against, nor what vices they suffer from. The same is true for priests when they praise their repentant parishioners, as they can do nothing but speak well of them, no less than parents do of their children.

From whom you fear, lest in your absence, he raises complaints against you, or causes turmoil, or something similar; keep him with you under the guise of friendship, in leisure, hunting, at the table, in conversation, and in military service, etc. So that neighboring nations do not rebel when you are engaged in another war, lead the most prominent among them with a small force, from which treachery cannot be feared, into battle as your most loyal allies.

It will be helpful that, while sitting at the table writing, you have a mirror in front of you, so you can see what is happening behind you.
