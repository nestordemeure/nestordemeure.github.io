Order the servant, who gives the thing, to provide a written agreement, in which everything is described and to be signed, as if he were acting for his own cause without your knowledge. Therefore, if you cannot avoid this situation, it is expedient for you to declare the borrower or to ask for something equivalent in return for the loan; pretending that you are in need, or that you indeed do not have an abundance of money that your friend asks for, but still being able to find it, and indeed without interest, as long as they provide collateral. Alternatively, if they have assets to be divided, obtain the price through a testimony, if they deposit something with you.
