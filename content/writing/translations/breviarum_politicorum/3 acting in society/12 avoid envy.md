Do not act as a witness, for you will collide with one party or another. Speak or give signs about no one without reason or in a derogatory way; if you wound with words, continue the conversation as if nothing happened. Do not show any particular favor to anyone in the presence of others, because those who think they are being overlooked will start to hate.

Avoid sudden splendor, as it dazzles the eyes before they become accustomed to looking at it. Do not criticize what is popular among the masses, whether they are vices or customs. If you have the author of some hateful deed, do not expose yourself to recent hatred, nor do things that seem to either approve or gloat over your deed or mock the injured; envy is greatly increased by this. It is better to stay away and let the deed pass in silence.

Do not introduce anything new in clothing or in the arrangement of a banquet.

If you make laws, do not distrust virtue, but compel everyone to act uniformly. Give reasons for your actions to satisfy everyone, but only after the fact, so as not to be hindered.

Have a universal principle in moderation, but be very fair; do not speak well or ill of anyone, do not recount good or bad deeds; perhaps there is a friend of a third party to whom you are speaking, thus you will collide, and your words, worsened, will eventually reach the person you are talking about. If you praise, perhaps the third party will be less of a friend to the one who hears, and thus become your enemy.

It is better to know, see, and hear many things, and to investigate them carefully; for it is offensive to inquire about oneself. Therefore, inquire in such a way that you do not appear to be asking questions.

Beware of excessive generosity, as it may seem like contempt; for example, if you say that you have soldiers in your pocket and you don't care, etc. Do not boast that you will proceed better and more rigorously according to the laws than your predecessors, as it alienates friends; and even if you do this rightly, only mention what is pleasing.

Do not entrust any of your servants with the right to judge others, or deal with them in such a way that you seem to be acting collectively, especially if they are hated by others, nor should they be exalted with unusual rewards unless everyone recognizes their virtue as an incentive.

If some severity must be done to our own people, let it be carried out through others, as if you were not commanding it; so that if those affected complain, you can diminish the impact and blame those who carried it out as the sole authors of the severity, e.g. Tribune, for discipline has been broken; let them turn to correction, which is necessary and harsh, but let no limit be prescribed, for those who defend themselves will resort to harsher measures and give you an opportunity to show benevolence towards the appellants.

Whoever has earned full glory from hardships, attribute everything that came from him to him, and attribute nothing to yourself; for in this way, praise will flow back to you in a full stream, without envy, and having done this will itself be glorious. Refer your good fortunes and successes to another good, e.g., as if you had acted with his help, auspices, or advice.

In success, do not claim anything for yourself; maintain the same conversation, table, clothing, and change only in a certain way in these things.

If someone must be punished, lead them to admit their guilt themselves or entrust the judgment to another, who, secretly instructed by you, will deliver a harsh sentence that you can then mitigate.

Do not insult the defeated or your antagonist, even if you have defeated him, nor proclaim yourself the victor in words or deeds, be content with true victory.

If you are forced to give an unfavorable opinion, resort to an ambiguous mode of speech, e.g., present arguments for both sides, but bring up weightier arguments for the one you favor, and at the same time, conclude or cut off the conclusion for the other side.

If someone asks you to intercede for them, promise to do so, but also show that the matter is not in your hands and may turn out differently than you wish.

If revenge is to be taken, let it be done through someone else or an unknown person, then order the injured party to forgive the offender; however, secretly allow them to flee as soon as possible.

If your parents are involved in a dispute, do not easily side with anyone, but investigate the matter so that you can distance yourself; this way, you will be excused by both sides, and neither will hate you, even if you did not follow either of their sides.

Do not be seen as the author of any new laws, especially unfair and harsh ones. Rarely associate openly with your superiors and the one who rules, and do not boast about their friendship.

If you are perceived to have power with the great ones, know that whatever they have done wrong will be attributed to you; therefore, make sure that your lord sees your counsel, accepts your intercessions, but arranges matters differently in your absence. This is especially applicable to the confessors of princes.

If your lineage and the greatness of your family are praised, divert the conversation so that they notice your modesty; then, the praise will be secure without envy. If you try to please, hatred will arise.

Do not publicly praise what is pleasing and favorable. And if by chance you are removed from office, show openly that you have been granted a favor and that your peace has been considered, and seek reasons to demonstrate this, so that no one will insult you.

Do not openly seek out who has been an enemy or his supporters, nor initiate a conversation about him; however, it is in your interest to know everything secretly.

Do not deal openly with those who are hated by everyone, nor suggest anything to them.

Be careful not to let anyone know that you were in a council where even the most insignificant decisions were made against them, although from afar you may be the author of those decisions.

Do not criticize anyone's actions, do not reprimand, do not inspect others' duties; do not willingly approach the places where others preside, fields, workshops, stables, etc., so as not to appear to be scrutinizing their actions.

Inquire very cautiously from servants and boys about what you want to know about their masters.

Make sure that there is nothing in your manners, gestures, walking, conversation, play, speech, and expressions, laughter, or fervor that could offend others.

No matter how busy you are, if someone approaches and asks you something, respond kindly and show that you consider them a welcome guest; have another occasion to excuse them from approaching you now. To ensure your peace, you will have to give up a lot of your own comforts.

No matter how many false and unproven things someone tells you, listen while they tell others; do not correct them or show that you know better. Do not treat anyone with jokes and ridicule as if you despised them, even in jest; accept them, but not so that they can realize they are being mocked by empty words. Even if someone is unsuccessful, do not ridicule them, but rather try to excuse and help them.

Never approve of slandering others, for it is the same whether you slander others yourself or show that you enjoy the slander of others.

Do not act against those who are not subject to you in a way that seems to exercise jurisdiction over them.
