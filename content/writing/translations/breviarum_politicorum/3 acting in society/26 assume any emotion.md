Create for yourself examples of emotions from Poets. Take what is found in the Palace of Eloquence, and whatever you need, practice it for as long as it takes to absorb it. Do not confide in even your closest friend that you are pretending, and show emotions not only in your face but also in your spirit and with words as flexible as your expressions; no fewer things are read from the face. Conquer your own timidity, so that, as if conscious of the matter, you act no less spiritedly in similar situations.
