Praise him whom you need to be moved by the influence of someone powerful, but let the praise result in offense to the patron, by adding such things as are carried by common rumor, not expressing your own opinion, and leaving it to the person you praise to look after his own reputation, making it clear that the reputation of those close to him is at risk. At the same time, he should be strengthened to despise rumors and let baseless ones fade away, yet he will sense that his own interests are being pursued. Praise the client as though sympathizing with his feelings, with a soft voice, presenting well-exaggerated praises and their consequences, say that he is outstanding, but marred by this flaw that you keep silent.

Never threaten someone whom you intend to harm, for they will take precautions, instead pretend to be unequal to the task, and unable to harm even if you wanted to. Draw him into friendship with you, involve him in social gatherings so that you make him unguarded, and have secret witnesses before whom you speak, so that they reveal something either against the prince, and there will be material for denunciation.

Exaggerate the enemy's actions; what evils will follow unless he is punished. Meanwhile, so that you don't seem to be giving in to your feelings, pray for his punishment, but ineffectively. Hatred must be thrown far and wide, interpreting manners and actions, and where opportunity arises, pushing the weakened one step by step towards his downfall.

Never attack many at once, but form friendships with others in the meantime.

Always establish your own affairs before attacking others', do not indulge in revenge, and do not neglect opportunities to advance your own interests.
