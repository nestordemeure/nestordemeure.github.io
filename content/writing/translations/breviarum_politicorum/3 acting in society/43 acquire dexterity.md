**TODO: title is likely mistranslated**

When someone is suffering, console them by not touching on commonplaces, as the Rhetoricians say, so as not to praise them on that occasion. If someone is criticized in your presence, be very cautious, neither praise nor condemn, as both are hateful.

Regarding your superiors, even if you are offended by them, speak well of them, do not allow or pretend to listen to others speaking ill of them, even if it pleases you. You will discover the truth of those who accuse something in your presence; listen to your accusers face to face, take note of the points, then order them to give you their accusations in writing, and say that you are doing this so that the accused can read them; compare and you will know the truth.
