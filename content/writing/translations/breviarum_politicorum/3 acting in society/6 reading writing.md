If you write something in a place where many people come, set up the written sheet, as if you were describing it, so that it is visible to all, and the things you truly write lie hidden, and are covered in such a way that only the line you have written is visible and can be read by anyone approaching. What you have indeed written, cover with a book or another sheet, or move the erected sheet closer.

If, while you read, someone approaches, immediately move several pages, so that your intention is not detected; indeed, it is suitable to have several books together at once, so that one is to be inspected before the other. However, if you write or read a book and someone else comes, in front of whom you read, you will be suspected, and from time to time propose something completely different from the book and letters; for example, if you write admonitions, etc., ask the arriving guest what you can cautiously and prudently respond to in such a situation; or ask for news, so that you can fill the letters; do the same when you count money or read a book.

Do not burden yourself with writing secrets in your own hand; unless you write in cipher; and such that can be read or understood by everyone, like those Trithemius provided in his Polygraphia, for these are better hidden if written by someone else's hand. Ciphers indeed arouse suspicion; and if it is discovered that you have written them, you can be compelled to give the key or the meaning of the writing is more easily revealed.
