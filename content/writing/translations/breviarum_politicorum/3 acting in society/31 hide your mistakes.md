If it happens that you make a slip of the tongue, or do something without thinking, pretend that you suddenly said it for the judgment of others to explore, or as if expressing someone else, smile as if you achieved your goal or mourn as if you didn't without revealing the truth.

If you have made a mistake unknowingly, don't ask anyone in a way that would reveal your ignorance or that you made a mistake; premeditate how you will seek the truth, or ask for the opinion of another person about what they would do in such a case, while hiding your own lack of knowledge in the meantime.

If you have forgotten something you said (which happens to those who do not pretend), be careful not to say the opposite by chance; in this case, it will be useful to take notes of the most important points you have mentioned. Be extremely cautious when confusing others, as you may either expose your ignorance or your intentions; therefore, be prepared for both possibilities.
