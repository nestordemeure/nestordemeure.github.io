It is expedient to note in history the mistakes made by princes so that successors do not follow the path by which those who went before perished.

That appropriate time is when a subject comes to congratulate, expecting nothing but praise, you reprimand; this is the genuine way of arguing.

Even the smallest deeds should be praised, thus diligence grows; it is best to advise through a friend who is in their confidence and privy to their secrets.

If someone is involved in illicit affairs and you want to free them, overwhelm them with tumultuous affairs; instigate those who would criticize their words or deeds to report to you, bearing false witness so that you may not approve any of their actions. Moreover, observe with whom they interact, and cut them off no less in that kind of example, men from men, women from women, because different sexes have harmed.

Associates should be assigned who do not excel in virtues but rather in opposing vices: this one fierce, that one gentle, those passionate, and others restrained.
