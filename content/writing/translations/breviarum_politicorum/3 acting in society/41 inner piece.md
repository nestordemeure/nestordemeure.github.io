Do not set a goal for yourself, nor put praise in it, to accomplish something within a determined time, because you may either neglect many unforeseen intervening matters, or if you are hindered, you will be disturbed.

Convince yourself that it is not probable for no error to be committed by your own people, and that nothing should be determined. Disregard the complaints about you, whether they are kept secret or not, hold on to them or not.

Do not engage more with gossipy and suspicious people about other people's lives than with the usual formulas, such as: how is he doing, etc.

Do not voluntarily promise anyone help in interceding; if it does not succeed, you will be disturbed.

Do not care for things to be done by artisans through yourself. With complaining, moaning women, and stubborn people, have no business.

If you are forced to go to places that you do not like, refuse, carry your own business, and act in them as if they were destined for other uses.
