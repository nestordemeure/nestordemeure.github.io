Begin by discussing other matters, then
address the deeds you wish to criticize,
exaggerate, reprimand, and add other circumstances
so that the person doesn't immediately realize they are being targeted. Frequently encourage
the listener to be of good mind
and cheerful, and mix in some jokes;
if they become sad, inquire about the cause, and then
at the end, bring up all other matters, even speaking of remedies
in an abstract manner.

If someone knows that they are suspected by you of a
vice, entrust them with secret matters,
but not at the risk to yourself. In this way, they will strive with all their
heart to dispel their suspicion and carry out the tasks assigned; hence, it is useful
to sometimes show suspicions.

Young people who are their own masters and prone
to wrongdoing, if you reproach them,
you will only inflame them more; therefore, it is better to wait for their
repentance or satiety.
If it happens that they listen to your advice, do not
abruptly transition from harsh to gentle,
with cold people act openly, instill fear;
with passionate people, act cautiously and gently.
