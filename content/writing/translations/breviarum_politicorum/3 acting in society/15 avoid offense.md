If you have shown yourself more difficult or less generous to someone in a particular situation, be careful not to display greater generosity towards others in a similar matter, no matter how inferior or equal they may be, as this will cause distrust and hatred between them.

Never increase your severity towards those you lead without also increasing your favors; otherwise, you will incur either hatred or contempt. However, if you increase both, you will mix love with fear. If you are starting something new that may offend others' eyes, let it be done with the authority of a prince to mitigate any resentment.

If you are believed to be the author of hateful policies, publicly do some good that is popular, such as granting pardons, especially to those who are well-received by the people.

If you are contemplating something unusual, first secretly meet with a theologian and others, and draw them to your side so that they publicly advise, promote, and even compel you.

When imposing new laws, show their necessity and deliberate with the wise; or at least spread the rumor that you used their advice, then reject the advice of others and establish other laws according to your judgment.

Do not procure a spouse, servant, or certain life situation for anyone; lest if the advice turns out badly, the blame for the sinister outcome falls on you, and you lose a friend.

Avoid being the executor of a will, as it rarely occurs without offending someone.

If you are in the company of someone while they are organizing their household and giving orders, be present but do not suggest methods or help.

If someone comes to a new place and praises their previous situation in terms of people and customs more freely, do not confirm their words and be more prudent.

If you feel the opposite, follow the milder opinion, whether in matters of conscience or others; but preach the stricter one.

Do not show in front of anyone that you have any influence or favor with your superiors. And do not reveal your opinion of someone else to anyone, not even under the promise of silence.

Always flatter your superiors for your own gain in any office you hold, and at least appear more lenient than strict towards your subordinates.

If you hear that someone you considered a friend has spoken ill of you, do not reproach them; you will make an enemy of someone who was previously indifferent.

Do not wish to know all the secrets of the great; if it happens to become public knowledge from another source, suspicion will fall on you. If someone comes to you to do something pleasing, e.g., congratulate, greet, etc., show that you are most grateful, lest they be alienated from you in the future.

If someone does not keep their word or promise, do not reproach them; you will gain nothing but hatred.

Allow your superior to defeat you in games as much as possible, as it is always a matter of glory and not of your loss; you are strong if you defeat other people, and if you are defeated only by your superior.

In whatever familiarity you have with a superior, never forget reverence and submission, otherwise, they will think that familiarity breeds contempt.

Do not boast that you have persuaded someone, even if they were willing, to join your side with your advice; they will resist more in the future. Do not insult the misfortune of someone who did not follow your advice, but rather excuse the outcome and cast the blame on the executors.

Do not boast about your wealth, strength, skill, plans, or assistance, and do not inquire about the secrets of others; if you know them, feign ignorance. If you are hurt by a greater injustice, do not complain, and do not let it be known that you are injured, because whoever hurts someone usually hates them.
