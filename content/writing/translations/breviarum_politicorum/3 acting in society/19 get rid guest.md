Instruct your servant, that when he receives a signal from you, he should call you as if urgent matters require your attention, such as the need to inflate gold, or send a courier with letters, or announce the damages done, or discuss disturbances among subjects, or inform you that doctors have prohibited you from speaking, drinking, &c. Prepare a saddled horse as if you were about to leave, provide oats for the horses, but first shake a lupine skin. Provide a stable, but where a wolf's carcass is buried. Provide a bedroom, but let the bed be infested with bedbugs, and the windows, when it rains, let in the rain. The chimney should be closed at the top so that it smokes, and the furnace should be new and emit a foul smell.
