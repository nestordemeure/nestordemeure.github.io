Never allow a multitude to act with you; admit only one chosen from among themselves.
Philosophers seek the causes of upheaval, and if it arises from usury, provide loans without usury yourself, offer great rewards. Whoever has quelled the sedition, suggests a method of resolving the sedition, removes the instigators, and exposes them, if the people are fierce, all things should be safely arranged through good men toward virtue, instilling the Fear of God and Piety, these alone will soften.
The inventors of factions should be discredited through scattered rumors, as they secretly seek their private good, dominion from the misfortune and bloodshed of others, and will gain no benefit from it.
