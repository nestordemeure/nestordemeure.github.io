Firstly, let there be no memories, but whatever is noteworthy, whether good or bad, should be noted in a language that is not common, so that if the native becomes aware, they are not offended.

Secondly, explore the path in public places, as well as private, both sacred and profane. Examine all the sacred things, epitaphs, anathemas, the tombs of illustrious men, funeral symbols, organs, columns, chairs, etc. Castles, mountains, forests, valleys, rivers, and their nature, effusions, origins, and the origin of names.

Thirdly, the constitution of the air, so that the Roman may not be praised by newcomers, but the better ones from Bologna and Padua, nights and days.

Fourthly, the location of cities, which part faces the region of the world, the mines of each metal, thermal baths, ships, ceremonies, bells, clocks, etc. These must be carefully inspected. Towers, such as the three most noble ones in Germany: Vienna, Strasbourg, Landburg. The lineages of cities and their origins, aqueducts, miracles, sieges.

Fifthly, the customs of the academies in conferring degrees.

Sixthly, the arts and artisans, armories, and in them machines, marbles, palaces, ways of dining, of which the earth is capable of producing.

Seventhly, the state of the republic, the power of the bishops, the customs in marriages, bacchanals, trade, piety, wealth, studies, and each of these must be investigated by those experienced; those things are especially noteworthy, which are useful to you, by which that nation is most delighted, in what part it can be conquered, how in every place the name and form of speaking are noted, the fruits preserved, and the gardens, caves, mines.

Do not enter underground places prone to errors without a well-equipped firestarter, place some candles in various locations, and if you enter alone, use Ariadne's advice, take the longest rope, so that you can exit by directing it through that; since often harmful air is in these caves, have perfumes and ointments, and protect yourself well before entering.

The management of both civil and military governance must be observed. Also, pay attention to how subjects obey the prince, and how ministers serve, by what means the strength of the province is maintained, and from what deficiencies it suffers. What is the manner of building, the fortifications, the garrisons, the nerves of the military, who and from where they intend to invade, and which passages are open; finally, whether there is more heat for great and daring plans than strength to execute them. Praise the nation you live among, and criticize the one being attacked. Because no one endures the reproaches of the faults of their people without great difficulty, as one who loves their ancestral customs with blind affection, and thinks it is noble to wash away the stain of their nation with blood. On the contrary, they take pleasure in the contempt of rivals.
