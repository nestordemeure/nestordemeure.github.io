These are the duties of cautious men: Cautious confidence, so that while you are dealing with friends in custody, yet many carry friendship before them to deceive, trust no one, unless you suspect.

Another is a certain Generosity, by which we do not want to indiscriminately tell the truth to everyone, correct errors or habits, whose kind of thing is preferred to simulation, this is useful, but it has hardly been without harm.

Do not entrust any secret because there is no one who cannot become an enemy after an hour.

In the hilarity of life do nothing, you will wander or be betrayed.

Do not assume that someone will interpret your deed for good, for there are hardly two such interpreters in the world.

Do not commit to letters anything that you would not have read by a third party, indeed praise it, so that it may come into his hands.

If you notice someone wanting to extract knowledge of a matter from you and pretending to know, do not correct the mistaken one.

Either ignore or excuse others' faults, close your feelings, or take on the opposite.

In whatever friendship, consider hatred; in fortune, adversity.

If you are victorious, in no case return the most noble captives to the enemy, so that as fortune turns, the enemy may have a reason to be compelled to make peace with you. Indeed, do good deeds to the enemy's leaders, maintaining some correspondence with them, unless you are pressed by an inexcusable necessity.

Do nothing in appearance, unless you are ready to give an account, for people, not waiting, will condemn your deeds; so now we live that certain virtues are condemned, not to mention dubious ones.

If you want to intercede for someone, their own commendation becomes the index of their merits, whom you recommend. For nothing is more to be guarded against than being burdensome to your superiors with importunate recommendations. And choose convenient times to speak. It is a miser's business to wish no one well. To prevent others from trading well is cruel-hearted.

For inferiors and servants, if they ask you for something, order them to leave it in writing for you, so that you can better inspect all the circumstances, but nevertheless, give the answers only orally.

If you converse with some, where there is a danger that they will be caught in a word, protest that you say many things for the sake of joking, even often testing some contradictions, winking at others: and in this way, if something incautious happens, you can excuse yourself for having protested beforehand that you often say things in jest.

If you are violently pushed into Games, Hunting and Love, and are torn away from your affections, completely forbid them, otherwise you will commit many things incautiously.

With infants, old men, hard men, and those who have a weak memory, moreover, deal mostly with tyrants in the presence of witnesses, receive written orders, and ask for them.

Do not give more impetuous advice to more ferocious men, they judge from the outcome, where it is credible that you are being observed, say very little, it is easy to slip in many things. In all things observe vices and virtues, so that if necessary, you can turn to either side: This will be a useful arsenal for many things.

Have the window shutters on the inside, and on the side where the windows touch, let them be black, so that it cannot be discerned whether the window is closed or not.

It is evident among the principal duties of a prudent man to be able to discern in which matters and with which persons you should give or even refuse advice. For there is a time when silence is cowardice, and speaking is recklessness.

Execute the proposed business with the Prince's uncertain will alone, and with arguments set forth on both sides, leave the free choice to the Prince.

If you are urged to give an opinion on an illegitimate matter, omit some pretext or delay for the sake of a more thorough examination, so that it may appear more carefully weighed, what is in accordance with the dignity and safety of the Prince.

In all things, observe vices and virtues, so that if necessary, you can turn to either side. This will be an arsenal for many things and useful.

Have the window shutters on the inside, and on the side where the windows touch, let them be black, so that it cannot be discerned whether the window is closed or not.
