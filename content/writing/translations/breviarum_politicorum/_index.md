The [Breviarum Politicorum Secundum Rubricas Mazarinicas](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Br%C3%A9viaire_des_politiciens) was published in 1684, bearing the name of [Cardinal Jules Mazarin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_Mazarin).
Diplomat, politician and advisor to kings, Mazarin was one of the key political figures of 17th-century France.
As such, the authorship of the text, published 23 years after his death, has been a subject of considerable debate.

Regardless of the actual author, this book stands as France's closest counterpart to [Machiavelli’s Prince](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prince) and, with each passing year, its distinctive perspectives on appearances, treachery, and strategic concessions feels ever more relevant.

For the curious reader, I highly recommend tracking down Umberto Ecco’s essay [The Signs of Power](/writing/translations/breviarum_politicorum/bonus/signs_of_power): it is the definitive Preface to the *Breviarum Politicorum*.
