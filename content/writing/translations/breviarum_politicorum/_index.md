The [Breviarum Politicorum Secundum Rubricas Mazarinicas](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Br%C3%A9viaire_des_politiciens) was published in 1684, bearing the name of [Cardinal Jules Mazarin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_Mazarin).
Diplomat, politician and advisor to kings, Mazarin was one of the key political figures of 17th-century France.
As such, the authorship of the text, published 23 years after his death, has been a subject of considerable debate.

Regardless of the actual author, this book stands as France's closest counterpart to [Machiavelli’s Prince](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prince) and, with each passing year, its distinctive perspectives on appearances, treachery, and strategic concessions feels ever more relevant.

For the curious reader, I highly recommend tracking down Umberto Ecco’s essay [The Signs of Power](/writing/translations/breviarum_politicorum/bonus/signs_of_power): it is the definitive Preface to the *Breviarum Politicorum*.

TODO: 
* improve translation (2 pass then contact tisde proofreader), 
* fact check with french edition, 
* clean up umberto eco essay, 
* make sure latin folder and online translation have the same content.

clean up latin reference:
* check for italic in latin reference
* restore proper linebreak in the first latin chapters
* check first characters of text in the first latin chapters
* check latin for difference in line separation between chapters: are there some subsection? (do they map to the axioms?)

cover:
[gallimar](https://www.grapheine.com/en/history-of-graphic-design/history-of-book-covers-4) style minimalistic cover (no illustration or just the shape of a cardinal's hat (but mazarin used to go with a minimalistic hat))
*but* writen in white (or cream, but not goldish, to avoid it getting yellow with time) on a cardinal red background (making it pop)
