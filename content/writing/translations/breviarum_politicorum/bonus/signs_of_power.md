## by Umberto Eco

Let's speak frankly. All we know about Cardinal Mazarin (apart from his name in school textbooks glimpsed towards the end of the Thirty Years' War) is what Dumas taught us in Twenty Years After. A particularly odious Cardinal, a sinister individual, a scoundrel and simulator in comparison to his eminent predecessor, the great Richelieu who knew how to defeat his enemies and grant a musketeer's patent to those who deserved it, Mazarin lies, breaks his word, hesitates to pay his debts, poisons the Duke of Beaufort's dog and trains it to bark at him. An Italian beggar, whom Beaufort calls *"the most illustrious scoundrel Mazarin."* He is a vile perjurer, a coward who slips, at night, into the bed of Anne of Austria, who in other times had known how to love men of Buckingham's mettle. Is it possible that Mazarin was such a good-for-nothing? We knew that Dumas, when describing historical characters, did not invent: he added color, set the stage, but was very attentive to sources, chronicles, memoirists, even for imaginary characters; so, you can imagine, a man of Mazarin's stature! So we read with full confidence.

I do not know if Dumas knew this *Breviarum Politicorum* attributed to Mazarin. It would have been possible, as the libel appeared in Latin in 1684, from an improbable publisher in Cologne, and then was amply translated and disseminated over the following centuries. Everything suggests that Dumas had only heard of it. Indeed, if we only evoke and briefly summarize the text, we get a Mazarin Ã  la Dumas, a cheap Machiavellian scheming to fake his outward appearance, his feasts, his words, and his actions to attract the favor of his masters and plunge his enemies into the darkest torments, throwing stones and immediately hiding his hand in his wide sleeves. But if we read it thoroughly, we find a character who, even if he remains the one Dumas so well described, surprises us at least by his complexity, his playfulness, the high theoretical rigor of his very human planned dishonesty.

The book, you may say, is not his; it is an anthology of his maxims, whether they are spoken or acted. In this case, why not read it as a satire, understood in the way some have interpreted Machiavelli, that is, as the work of a skillful moralist who, pretending to give advice to the prince, *"strips him of his disguises and reveals him to the people,"* as Ugo Foscolo asserts in The Tombs? Be that as it may, the author of this libel - Mazarin or anyone else - took seriously what he wrote because, in the seventeenth century - Croce reminds us in History of the Baroque Age in Italy - *"simulation and dissimulation, cunning and hypocrisy were, because of the oppressive conditions of society at the time, a very practical art, giving rise to countless treatises on politics and prudence."*

The text of Machiavelli was rather a treatise on imprudence, daring to proclaim loudly and clearly the way in which the Prince should act for the good of all. Only here's the thing, the Counter-Reformation and the Jesuit casuistry have passed through there: the small treatises of the 17th century no longer teach anything but how to defend oneself in a world of disloyal princes, and henceforth all too consciously Machiavellian, in order to save one's inner dignity or physical integrity, or even to make a career.

Before Mazarin's, two other breviaries appeared on the cultural scene, much better known: *The Courtier* by Baltasar Gracian (1647) and *Della dissimulazione onesta* by Torquato Accetto (1641). Although there was material for inspiration, Mazarin's breviary seems original in its shameless intentions. Gracian and Accetto were not men of power, and their painful meditation concerns the techniques by which, in difficult times, one could defend oneself from the powerful. For Gracian, it was a matter of trying to live in harmony with one's fellow men while suffering as little as possible (that said, he suffered in his life, being less prudent than what he preached); as for Accetto, his problem was not to simulate what one is not (that would be deception) but to dissimulate what one is, in order not to overly irritate others by one's own virtues (the question was not how to cause harm but how not to suffer it). Mazarin is far from all this: he establishes the program of a man who, by learning to win the favor of the powerful, to make himself loved by his subjects, to eliminate his enemies, succeeds in retaining power through techniques of simulation.

Simulation, not dissimulation. Mazarin (or whoever wrote the text) has nothing to hide: nothing, because he is solely what he produces as an external image. Look at the first chapter, titled in a simulative way, *"Know Thyself."* It starts with an aphorism on the necessity of examining oneself carefully to know if one is *"dominated by any passion"* (and even here, the question is not *"who am I?"*, but *"how do I manifest myself to myself?"*), then immediately continues, designating a self that is nothing but a skillfully constructed mask: Mazarin has a very clear notion of the subject as a semiotic product, and Goffman should read this book, a true manual for the total theatricalization of the Self. Here is outlined an idea of psychological depth entirely made of superficiality.

We have here a model of *"democratic"* strategy (in the age of absolutism!) because instructions on how to obtain power through violence are very rare and extremely measured; and if there is violence, it is never direct but always through intermediaries. Mazarin gives us a splendid image of obtaining power through the pure and simple manipulation of consensus. How to please not only one's master (fundamental axiom), not only one's friends but also one's enemies, whom one must praise, coax, convince of our goodwill and good faith, so that they may die, but blessing us.

I would like to emphasize again the first chapter, which is fundamental. By *"know thyself,"* we generally mean knowledge of the soul. Here, on the contrary, everything relates to external appearance, meaning: examining the way we present ourselves to others. As for the maxims concerning others, they also focus on symptoms, revealing signs, both for countries, cities, and landscapes, as well as friends and enemies. How to find out if someone is a liar, if they love someone else, if they deceive them; and the advice is very subtle, like: *"Praise someone highly in the presence of a third party. If the latter remains silent, it means they are not a friend of the first. [...] Another possibility [...] greet them on behalf of this supposed friend, or tell them you have received bad news about them, and observe their reaction."* Similarly, methods for knowing if a person can keep a secret: send someone you trust to provoke and confide in them, then see if they reveal anything or maintain an impenetrable mask, similar to the one Mazarin ingeniously constructs for himself, even suggesting how to write a letter in the presence of others without anyone being able to read it, or how to hide what you are reading, and finally the need to appear as a serious man (*"Do not give the impression of staring at your interlocutor, do not rub your nose, do not frown either, [...]. Be economical with your gestures, keep your head straight and a somewhat sententious tone. [...] Let no one attend your rising, your lying down, or your rest."*).

And always make your opponent willingly do what you want to lead them to: *"If someone aspires to an honor that you also covet, secretly send an emissary who, in the name of friendship, dissuades them by representing the many obstacles they would have to face anyway."* And be prepared for all traps, in order to counteract them: *"Every day, or on certain predetermined days, devote a moment to studying how you would react to this or that event that might occur,"* which resembles the modern theory of *"war and peace scenarios,"* except that at the Pentagon, computers apply it.

And we even learn how to escape from prison (anything can happen to a man of power), how to encourage the publication of one's own panegyric, in the form of brief and inexpensive works, so that it appeals to *"readers from the four corners of the world."* The author also teaches us to conceal wealth (and indeed, Dumas hit the nail on the head) but with some exceptions: at one point, he delves into the surprising description of a breathtaking meal, designed to dazzle guests, impossible to summarize... a true bravura piece worthy of the best baroque theater.

But let's finish with admiration. We read a book like this to derive some benefit from it. Well, don't think it can help you become a man of power. Not that its maxims are bad; they are all good. However, it tells us what a person of power already knows, often by instinct. In this sense, it is not just a portrait of Mazarin; it is a practical guide for everyday life. You will find many people you know from having seen them on TV or met in business. On every page, you will say to yourself: *"I know that person!"* Naturally. Mazarins become famous and never experience decline. An Italian politician (quite close to Mazarin's world) said: *"Power wears out those who do not have it."* Long before him, Mazarin specified that power only wears out those who do not already know all these things.
