While I have assembled, proofread and edited this translation, the bulk of the work was done by leveraging [GPT4](https://openai.com/product/gpt-4)[^prompts].

I used it to both combine several low-quality scans of 17th-century editions of the book into a single reference (available [here](https://github.com/nestordemeure/nestordemeure.github.io/tree/main/content/writing/translations/breviarum_politicorum/latin)) 
and to perform the first draft of the translation from Latin to English, hinting at the fact that it was written by Cardinal Mazarin to nudge it toward the appropriate writing style.

While the text is loosely organized into consecutive parts, I made the decision to regroup the `Fundamentals` and `In Society` chapters into their own sections (based on the fact that they have what appears to be section headings).

There are minor differences between the two editions I have used as sources.
I have erred toward including all of the text (as it seems more likely that text was lost with time rather than added by subsequent authors) as well as breaking it into one idea per paragraph following the logic of the original (some paragraphs seem to have been merged with time).

Finally, this translation was checked against an [existing French translation](https://www.arlea.fr/Breviaire-des-politiciens) to make sure that the meaning of the text was not altered[^differ].

[^prompts]: See [here](https://github.com/nestordemeure/nestordemeure.github.io/tree/main/content/writing/translations/breviarum_politicorum/latin) for fine details on the translation process, intermediate results and prompts used.

[^differ]: The meaning of some passages *does differ* between both translations, mostly where the original is so terse that one needs to interpret it to keep the text readable.
