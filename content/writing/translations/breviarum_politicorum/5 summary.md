Keep these five things in mind:

1. **Simulate.**
2. **Dissimulate.**  
3. **Trust No One.**
4. **Praise All.**
5. **Mind Your Words**

#### Simulate, Dissimulate

Show yourself as a friend to all and converse even with those you dislike, so that you may learn from their behavior and be cautious in your dealings with them.

Control your anger in all situations, as it can damage your reputation more than many virtues will enhance it.

Always strive to choose the easier path when faced with a difficult decision, as it often aligns with the majority and brings fewer disadvantages.

Always be cautious about sharing your thoughts, knowledge, desires, concerns, and aversions. Ensure that no one knows your true feelings on any matter.

Do not conceal your virtues excessively, and avoid criticizing lengthy sacred rites, as doing so may make you appear irreverent.

Even if you can achieve your goals through more aggressive or forceful means, refrain from using such methods.

#### Trust no One

When someone praises you, be convinced that they mock you.

Refrain from divulging secrets to others, as they may use them to tarnish your reputation.

Avoid self-praise or self-deprecation, as others may use your words against you.

Be restrained in your behavior and actions, as they will be the basis for how others judge you.

If someone criticizes or upsets you, use it as a chance to showcase your integrity and moral strength.

Be cautious of those who appear friendly, they are insincere.

#### Praise All

Always speak positively, or not badly, about others. If someone hears your praise, they will likely inform the person you spoke well of.

Always speak well of your superiors, for it serves the peace.

Also, praise those whose favor you need.

Similarly, express appreciation for the food and clothing you receive from others.

#### Mind Your Words

Consider your words carefully. Could they be interpreted negatively? If so, they certainly will be interpreted that way. Someone you do not see may be watching or listening.
