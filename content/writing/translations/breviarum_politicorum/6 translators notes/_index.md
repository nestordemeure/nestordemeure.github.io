The following notes, and documents, detail the translation process.
I expect that they will be mostly of interest to people desiring to understand the compromises done during the translation, reproduce the process, or build on the work.

You will find the corresponding code [here](https://github.com/nestordemeure/breviarium). *Do not hesitate to contact me if you want to work on this data or can suggest fixes to the Latin reference or its translation!*
