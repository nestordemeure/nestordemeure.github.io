# Breviarum Politicorum

## A Word from the Publisher

I had been delaying the publication[^printer] of this Political treatise, sent to me by an Italian Prince, due to being overwhelmed with the most pressing matters. Now, under the orders of that same Excellent Prince, I am making it public. The importance of the subject, and the name of Cardinal Mazarin, whose life serves as the model and standard for the ideas presented here, will add significant weight to the commonly proposed political rules. Everyone is aware of the serious storms the Eminent Prince faced and nearly succumbed to.

[^printer]: This introduction was written by the *original* printer and, maybe, by the actual writer of the text.

However, the skills he used to overcome those various tides of misfortune, which seemed certain to overwhelm him, and how he navigated through them to reach a safe harbor, are not so obvious to everyone. He achieved great things in managing a powerful Kingdom torn apart by factions during those dangerous and challenging times, and emerged from numerous difficulties with increased glory. Notably, he instilled in the mind of *Louis XIV*, easily the greatest of all French Kings, the principles of ruling that allowed him to vastly expand France's borders and raise it to the height of dignity and power upon taking the throne. Extracting these lessons is difficult, but this Treatise will spare you that task.

As there is hardly any complete and perfected system of Political precepts, since the general rules can be altered by an infinity of circumstances, no simpler or more fortunate method can be provided than to make the discipline, supported only by general precepts, practical or active by adapting those general rules to the particular circumstances on which they depend. But you will more easily achieve that goal, dear Reader, if you strive to keep this illustrious example before your eyes, according to whose model today's Politicians attempt to conform and adapt their rules using their own wisdom.

However, I wish for you to conduct yourself in a way that allows you to clearly understand the reasoning and norms that Political men typically use, not to deceive others, but to avoid being deceived yourself, by combining the two norms of the highest prudence prescribed with the general rule of fairness and justice, and the teaching of the Gospel:

> *Do not do to others what you would not want done to you, Be wise as Serpents, and innocent as Doves.*

Enjoy this work of ours, and farewell.

## I. Fundamentals

In the past, two fundamental principles dominated philosophy: *Sustain* and *Abstain*.
However, new principles have since emerged, namely *Simulate* and *Dissimulate*, and, complementing them, *Learn About Yourself* and *Learn About Others*.

We will first address *Learn About Yourself* and *Learn About Others*.
Then, since human *Actions* do not follow a particular order, we will explore the principles of *Simulate and Dissimulate* in various contexts.

### Learn About Yourself

Are you overcome by anger, fear, rashness, or some other strong emotion?
What defects are evident in your conduct during various activities, such as dining, attending church, conversing, playing games, or engaging in other social interactions?

Examine all the parts of your body: are your eyes too insolent, foot or head bent too far, forehead wrinkled, lips unkempt, gait too slow or too fast?

With whom do you associate? Are they praiseworthy, successful, prudent individuals?

At what times are you most likely to act carelessly or recklessly? Do you stumble in word or deed when drinking at the table, playing games, or facing calamity? As [Tacitus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacitus) noted, "the minds of mortals are pliable" during such moments.

What places do you visit - are they suspect, vile, disreputable, unworthy of you?

Be always cautious in your actions, to which end reading this little book will serve.

Consider the place, time, situation, and the rank of the persons with whom you are interacting.

Make note of each of your individual defect, so that you may address it more diligently; whenever you slip up, it will be beneficial to discipline yourself strictly.

If you are provoked to the point of anger, remain silent and show no sign of it, especially when you cannot effectively express your zeal or satisfy yourself. Instead, *pretend* that you are not offended and wait for a more opportune moment. Show nothing in your face except kindness, or even affection.

Do not readily laugh at just any witticism.

Strive to have everyone figured out. Never reveal your secrets to anyone; fish for the secrets of others.

Say or do nothing indecorous in the presence of anyone, even if it is natural and not malicious, such things are despised by others.

Maintain a modest and steady demeanor, but keenly observe everything with sharp eyes and an inquisitive expression. Those who do so are considered prudent, astute, and precise.

### Learn About Others

Much can be learned about someone's true character in situations like sickness, drunkenness, gain or loss of money, games, and travel. When the doors of the mind are relaxed, the wild beasts more readily emerge from their dens.

Pay attention to how people behave during times of affliction, especially when they are insulted or facing other challenges. Interact with those you wish to know better during these situations to gain insights into their character.

It helps greatly to frequent someone's friends, children, young servants, and attendants. They can often be easily bribed with small gifts to reveal much about the person.

If you suspect what the other person is thinking, try suggesting the opposite in conversation and praising it. If they disagree with your suggestion, they will likely abandon caution and defend their true opinion or add something to show they feel otherwise, thus revealing their actual thoughts.

To recognize someone's vices, try this technique: In conversation, mention the common vices that your friend is likely to struggle with. He will most fiercely attack and curse the very vice he himself is guilty of.
Thus, preachers are often prone to the very vices they most ardently denounce.

Ask for advice on some matter; after a few days, discuss it with the same person, for by God's providence we easily forget lies we have told.

To gauge someone's expertise on a topic, pretend to have knowledge about it and mention it in their presence. If they are knowledgeable, they will likely reveal their expertise by correcting you.

See with whom a person associates, for a man is known by the company he keeps.

Praise someone or console them in affliction, because in such cases obscure and hidden thoughts burst forth.

Entice someone to tell their life story, which can be done by pretending to share your own. Pay attention to any wicked deeds they have done to others, as this will give you grounds to reason about their present character. However, be cautious not to reveal yourself.

You can test someone's knowledge or character by presenting them with specific situations. For example, give them a mediocre epigram to read. If they praise it excessively, they likely have little poetic ability. If they praise it only to the extent it deserves, they may be a skilled poet. Similarly, if you bring up the subject of food and they show excessive enthusiasm, they may be a glutton. This principle can be applied to other vices and virtues as well.

Have someone guess at a gathering, as if in jest, what each person's abilities are, what virtues they have, what office they are suited for - for often jests weave much truth.

You can also sometimes play the role of a doctor, mixing things into their food that will make them cheerful and talkative.

It is a sign of a malicious man to frequently contradict; one who often stoops to theft is like this.

Those who boast much about themselves are not greatly to be feared; they are fantasizers.
Similarly, those who are scrupulous, gloomy, say many vocal prayers, have excessively short fingernails, and practice external mortifications without internal reflection are often prone to self-deception and fantasizing.

You will recognize one raised from poverty if he starts to complain about food and clothing, for the poor, when elevated, especially desire such things above the nobility.

Those devoted to wine and lust rarely keep secrets. The latter are slaves to their desires; the former are carried away to inconsiderate speech when inebriated.

To catch a braggart in a lie, listen carefully when he boasts about his journeys, travels, military service, exploits, and how many years he spent in various places. Later, add up the total of all the years he mentioned. On another occasion, ask him what year he began and finished each experience, and how many years his life spans. Any inconsistencies in his story will become evident.
Also ask if he knows how many towers that famous city has, or that most celebrated fortress (make up a name) - or congratulate him, as if knowing everything, that he escaped this or that danger.

You can recognize an upright and pious man by the consistency in his life, the absence of excessive ambition or desire for higher positions, genuine modesty, and uncontrived composure. His speech should not be overly effeminate, and he should not display excessive outward mortification by drinking or eating too little, or engaging in other ostentatious practices.

Those who most boast of being free from ambition and pride, and who act in an overly friendly manner when offended, are by nature melancholic or phlegmatic. Those who have an affected gentleness, a little bump on the nose, and sharp eyes are usually cunning.

Ask for advice from someone and his prudence, skill, etc. will be recognized.
Hence one should pretend to be of two minds and uncertain when asked for advice.

Put little trust in one who promises easily, for he is a liar and deceiver.

Judge someone to be a keeper of secrets if he never reveals the secrets of another to you, even in friendship.
Convince a friend to entrust something to the individual you are testing, or have them try to obtain information from the individual that you have entrusted. However, be aware that people are more likely to disclose secrets to women, children, their beloved, and those they consider superior to themselves.
If he reveals someone else's secret to you, entrust him with nothing, because he may have someone he loves as much as you.

It will sometimes be helpful to intercept, read and resend the letters of one's subjects.

Those who have too many particular and elegant possessions are effeminate and often not very holy. Those who have excessively ornate weapons are often poor soldiers; those with overly refined tools of their trade are often poor craftsmen, unless youth excuses it. Likewise, those who indulge their own nature too much and are excessively handsome and likeable are often unlearned.

You will detect a flatterer in this way: pretend you have done something that is clearly absurd and boast about it. If he praises it, he is a flatterer; if he criticizes it, or at least remains silent, he is not.

You will notice a false friend if a third party, instructed by you, reports to him that you have been reduced to the utmost extremity, that the laws on which you relied have been found to be false; if he hears this as if unconcerned, he will never be a friend. Also send someone to seek advice from him in your name and at the same time ask for help; you will see what kind of person he is. Having tested his proven virtue, pretend that everything was falsely reported.

The uneducated betray themselves by excessive elegance in their possessions, by the decoration of their walls, by their fastidiousness about their bed, or if something is said that is less than pure Latin, by laughing and showing they noticed it.

Beware of men of small stature: they are obstinate and factious.

You will test the harmony between friends in this way: disparage one of them by name in front of the other; then praise him - from the silence or lukewarm response you will discern the whole matter.

Discuss situations in a group setting, how one could proceed ingeniously in this or that case; each person's cleverness and cunning will be evident from their response. Also suggest how this or that person could be deceived; bring up the topic of persecutions. He who says the most will prove he has suffered the most.

Liars are often by nature those who have dimples in their cheeks when they laugh.

Do not greatly fear those who are excessively concerned with their own skin.

Much can be learned about any matter from the young and the very old.

Those who vacillate between approval and disapproval on a matter are hypocrites. Devise situations that will bring their duplicity to light.

Those who know many languages are often of poor judgment, because an excess of memory often hinders judgment.

If someone suddenly displays great virtues, having previously been wicked, be suspicious.

If you think someone will betray your words, speak some unique things in front of them, things you have said in front of no one else; if those specific details are later spread, you have found the informer.

If others tell you their dreams, ask the frequent dreamer about different dreams, and after some discussion you will learn much about their secret mind. For example, if someone says they love you, on another occasion fish for dreams; if they never dream of you, their love is feigned.

Explore another's feelings toward you by showing your efforts, or by pretending to be his enemy.

Show no knowledge of any vice, and do not relate the vices of others with censure or excessive zeal, or you will be judged to labor under the same ones.

If an accuser comes to you, intending to betray another, pretend you have already heard it, and many other things besides; then you will see what suspicions and particulars he will add that he would not otherwise have said.

Those who act too tenderly with dogs and children are soft. Those who speak with a fake voice and a fake cough are effeminate, prone to lust; so too are those who are excessively well-groomed, adorned, desiring to please the eyes of others, and too observant of a younger or more feminine age.

Deceivers are those who concede everything too easily, who excessively approve of all your actions, because their friendship is feigned.

Beware of associating with one who constantly speak ill of others in your presence. They will probably do the same to you when you are not around.

Catch a keeper of secrets in this way: tell him something under the strictest secrecy; tell the same thing to another with the same caution; set up a third party, aware of the deception, to convene these two and insinuate something about what was entrusted. Here it will appear what each one will betray, and who will betray it first. If they realize all three of them know something together, the one who does not betray it then - make him your secretary.

To learn another's mind, suborn someone whom they love, and through them you will discover their most secret thoughts.

## II. Acting in Society

As I begin this part of the discussion, I will explore various contexts without adhering to a strict order.

### Gaining Favor with a Friend

Identify your friend's interests and choose gifts that align with them. Suitable items include mathematics books, optical instruments, microscopes, sundials, various mirrors, and other curiosities, as well as treatises on the secrets of nature, such as those written by [Mizauld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Mizauld).

Speak with him often, consult him, and ask for his advice, then follow it. But never lay yourself so bare that if he becomes your enemy, he can use it against you.

Do not ask him for favors that would be difficult to grant, especially those involving property or money.

Congratulate him briefly but elegantly on special occasions such as feast days, birthdays, and when he recovers from illness.

Praise his virtues sparingly, but consistently ignore his vices.

Share your travels with him and tell him about the praises others have spoken of him, confidentially sharing details with him, especially things said by his superiors.

Never reveal his faults or vices, no matter how much he may ask. If he insists and you are afraid of appearing untrustworthy, mention only the mildest faults or those he has openly acknowledged himself. For such things leave a bitter memory, no matter how they are said, especially if there is too much truth in them.

Have mutual acquaintances convey your greetings frequently, and send your own regards in letters.

Never defend an opinion contrary to your friend's. If you have dared to voice a differing opinion, allow your friend to persuade you. Show that you have been swayed and conceal your disagreement.

Be liberal in giving him titles and eagerly offer services you will never need to fulfill.

Do not seek to please anyone by indulging their vices or engaging in behavior that conflicts with your status.
For example, if you are a clergyman, avoid excessive jesting, vulgar humor, heavy drinking, and other inappropriate behaviors. While these may win affection in the moment, they will eventually lead to contempt, ridicule, or even fierce hatred, though it may not arise immediately.
Therefore, even if at times it may be expedient to act in a less than virtuous manner, do so without engaging in outright vice.

When you arrive somewhere new, first identify those who are favored by the master of the place and those who have influence through their faction and eloquence. Win their favor by any means, so that you can use their advice and influence in promoting your interests. These people will take some of the responsibility upon themselves when they give counsel.

If you wish to take revenge on someone, make that person appear suspicious to your friend and turn your friend's envy to your cause.

Never commit any crime at your master's behest, for even if you win his gratitude in the moment, he will thereafter view you as a critic, able to do to your master what you readily undertook at his command, a man whose faith and virtue are for sale. At the very least, distance yourself from the reward for the deed as soon as it is done.

Write letters praising a third party, then deliberately allow them to be lost or intercepted so that they reach the third party you are praising.

Many people assume that what pleases them will also please others, and they act accordingly. Instead, you should prudently explore the other person's preferences and dislikes, tailoring your actions to what pleases them.

Address even your inferiors as brothers and preempt them with honors, provided they are of good character.

Never provide pleasing things to the point of satiety, lest you induce nausea. Leave them wanting more, whether in games, conversation, etc.

Never borrow from a friend. If he cannot grant what you ask, it will offend him, and he will hate you. If he reluctantly agrees or receives back less than the full amount, he will resent it.

Never buy from a friend, for if he sells dearly, you will be harmed; if cheaply, he will be.

Treat even his lowliest servants well, otherwise they will gradually turn your friend's mind against you.

At banquets, foster loyalty with servants by entrusting them with fabricated secrets, even some related to their duties, and show that you hold them in a special position.

If you are too familiar with servants, they will hold you in contempt. If you are angry with them, they will hate you. However, if you treat them with a calm, dignified manner, they will revere you.

With free men, show benevolence, love, and courtesy. Do not allow them to stoop to humble services or extreme gestures of submission, such as kissing feet. However, consider the greedy to be on the same level as slaves in terms of their disposition.

If you seek the favor of the people, promise to promote their interests, especially those that benefit individuals, for they are moved more by these than by honor.

If invited to dine with inferiors, accept, find no fault in anything, surpass them all in civility while preserving your dignity, and at least be liberal in your words. Take care not to take or appropriate anything of theirs against their will.

Frequently show compassion, console, and bestow favors in stages.

Despise nothing, but rather praise.

If you must contradict, do not accuse them of imprudence or ignorance, but rather, having praised their reasoning and good intentions, point out the disadvantages and costs that would follow.

Always show yourself a champion of the people's freedoms.

Observe the friend whose favor you wish to gain - is he given to arms or to learning, to clemency or to ferocity?

Rarely act as an intercessor, for whatever is done for others on your account is taken from you, and your favor will not remain intact. Keep the ruler wholly for yourself.

Reveal no one's secrets to another, for you will then be of little worth to him.

If he commands you to commit a crime, delay, and think of a way to excuse yourself. Feign illness, stolen horses, etc.

First win over the servants of one whose friendship you seek, even bribing them with gold if necessary; they will draw over their master as well.

However far you advance in his favor, treat it no differently than if you were still seeking it through a thousand kindnesses: for favor, once acquired, wishes to be maintained so as not to be lost; indeed, it requires to be nourished by attentions.

### Identifying Mutual Friends

If you praise someone and a listener remains silent in response, it indicates that the listener is not truly the praised person's friend.

You can also tell that a person is not another's friend if they respond to your praise in certain ways. These include diverting the conversation elsewhere, speaking halfheartedly or reluctantly, diminishing the praise, claiming the story is inconsistent, attributing part of the praise to others, or failing to enhance your praise despite knowing about a praiseworthy deed.
Other indications that a person is not a genuine friend include: dismissing a deed as a chance occurrence, attributing it to God's extraordinary providence, claiming that others have accomplished equal or greater feats, or suggesting that it was achieved through the counsel of another.

To test a person's true disposition towards their friend, you may forge letters pretending to be from the friend and send them to that person, asking for something to be entrusted. The recipient's response to this request will reveal whether their disposition towards the friend is favorable or not.

When greeting a person, do so in the name of another friend or mention that you heard someone speak ill of the person you are greeting. This will allow you to observe their reaction and see what they add to the conversation.

### Gaining Esteem and Reputation

Never assume that someone will keep a secret if you act or speak too freely or confidently in their presence, even if they are a child or servant. They will judge you by this action and describe you accordingly to others.

Never assume that someone will excuse your questionable behavior; in fact, they will likely interpret it in the worst possible way. To prevent this, avoid engaging in any actions that could be seen as questionable, even if there is only one witness.

Do not relate how you were previously defamed or wronged, for you will only defame yourself further and there will be those who approve.
When your actions are questioned, the saying ["Excuse the intention even if you cannot excuse the deed"](https://archive.org/details/St.BernardOnTheSongOfSongs/page/n234/mode/1up#:~:text=Excuse%20his,excuse%20the%20act) does not apply as some may claim that you acted wrongfully by accident, without thought, or that you deliberately sought out evil to test them.

At times, particularly with talkative individuals, you can strategically share a secret, asking them not to reveal it to others. For example, confide that you have significant influence with powerful people or maintain correspondence with them. To support this claim, write letters to these powerful individuals out of sight, seal them, and make a show of destroying the replies you have carelessly kept. However, be cautious with this tactic, as people may distort information they only partially hear.

Boast that you have never harmed anyone and that, if there had to be one thing for which you expect a divine reward, it is this. You can give examples invented on the spot to support your claim.

Whatever is to be made public, no matter how small, do it as perfectly as possible, because often a long-lasting reputation depends on a single act.

Never take on many things at once, because there is no glory in doing many things, only in perfecting one thing. I attest this from experience.

It is always proper and useful to yield to the angry, the powerful, and relatives. Feign humility of mind, candor, generosity, and cheerfulness. Praise, give thanks, and readily offer yourself, even to the undeserving.

The beginnings of any endeavor should be approached with the highest level of advice and effort, and with a strong conviction in their success. The trajectory of the initial stages often determines the course of the entire endeavor, and once achieved, fame can turn even missteps into triumphs.

If there is something you are obligated to do by your office, do not take it on at anyone's request, as it will diminish your commitment to your primary responsibilities. Remember, your reputation will suffer if you neglect your duties even slightly or simply because you took on additional tasks, regardless of your other accomplishments and the distractions you've managed.

When negotiating affairs, avoid partnering with someone more suitable or experienced than you. When approaching someone, do not bring along a companion who is more well-received or respected. When changing office, do not allow successors who are notably better than you.

Ensure that the honors and achievements of your family or lineage are recorded in print, disregarding any accompanying criticism. Whatever is written with truth and dedication will one day be regarded as plausible. In contrast, spoken words fade with or before the speaker.

You will establish a reputation for knowledge in this way: Compile a small book of historical facts and anecdotes, and reread it monthly during your leisure time. This will help you remember the information, allowing you to demonstrate your knowledge when necessary.

Have many prepared formulas for responding, greeting, speaking, and handling any situation that may arise unexpectedly.

Some individuals debase themselves too much in order to be praised, or so that they may seem to be favored by luck rather than burdened by concerns, and to possess natural talent instead of relying on effort. They begin to neglect and despise themselves, often convincing others to regard them as lazy and feeble. Leave these actions to those dedicated to religious duties.

Never act to the full extent of your power, so that you may be believed to be unable to do anything more.

What you can do, correct, or punish through servants, do not do yourself. You do the greater things.

Do not dispute uncertain things, unless you know you will certainly win.

If you arrange a banquet, share your fortune with the servants of the guests. This is a talkative crowd with significant influence in spreading a bad reputation. A generous gesture should captivate their attention, preventing them from prying into other matters. Similarly, deal generously with barbers and prostitutes.

### Finding More Time for Business

Delegate minor tasks to others.

Establish a strict schedule for yourself and adhere to it without deviation.
Allocate the smallest amount of time to the smallest tasks, and spend only the time needed to complete each task effectively.

When fatigued by work, avoid undertaking anything further. Instead, refresh yourself with honest play and physical activity. Afterward, you will accomplish more, with greater ease and in a shorter time.
If you must work, take on a task that you can handle without effort.

Divide tasks that span several days into smaller, manageable portions to complete them more efficiently.

Avoid engaging in time-consuming, useless tasks that offer little benefit or recognition, regardless of who requests them.

Refrain from personally dealing with craftsmen, household affairs, gardens, and construction projects, as these tasks are labor-intensive and give rise to one concern after another.

### Acquiring Gravity

Undertake occupations suitable to your role: for example, a Prelate should not handle weapons, a Nobleman should not practice chiromancy, a Religious person should not practice medicine, and a Priest should not teach fencing.

Avoid making promises or concessions.

Laugh sparingly, and when you do, keep it brief.

Do not change what has been decided.

Avoid staring at others.

Do not turn up your nose or furrow your brow.

Do not be sullen.

Make few gestures.

Keep your head erect.

Use few, concise and meaningful, words.

Do not take excessively wide steps. Compose all of your limbs with decorum.

Do not admit to anyone that you love, hate, or fear.

Do not personally handle menial tasks; delegate them to servants and do not discuss them.

Let no one be present when you are eating, going to bed, or getting up.

Keep your circle of friends small and interact with them infrequently, lest you be held in contempt.

Do not engage in conversation indiscriminately in public places.

Avoid abrupt changes in your habits, dress, lifestyle, or appearance, even if these changes are improvements.

When praising or criticizing, avoid excessive exaggeration. Judge proportionately to the matter at hand to prevent your words from losing their impact or credibility.

Rarely display strong emotions, such as excessive joy, admiration, or other feelings.

Demonstrate piety even in the presence of your closest friends.

Even when you are most confident in your position, refrain from complaining about or accusing others.

Do not give your subordinates too many tasks at once or tasks they cannot carry out. Doing so will either lead them to either despise your commands or demonstrate that your orders were ill-advised.

Make no laws, or very few.

Do not be quick to anger, for if you are then quick to be appeased, you will be considered fickle.

If you are going to make a public statement, carefully consider your words beforehand and speak from a prepared text.

### Reading and Writing

If you are writing in a public place, pretend to be copying from another document. Hold up a sheet of paper so others can see it, while keeping your actual writing hidden. Cover your work with a book or another sheet of paper, or position the raised paper so that only the line you appear to be copying is visible to anyone who approaches.

If someone approaches while you are reading, quickly turn to a different page to avoid drawing attention to your focus. It is best to have multiple books combined, allowing you to present one for inspection while concealing the actual book you were reading.

If you are writing letters or reading a book and someone arrives who might find your activity suspicious, anticipate this and pretend to be doing something else entirely. Act as if you are consulting the book or letters in front of you.
For example, if you are writing warnings, ask the approaching guest what you could cautiously and prudently respond to such a case, or ask for news so you could fill the letters. Employ similar tactics when counting money or reading a book.

Do not hesitate to write secrets in your own hand, unless you are employing ciphers that are easily decipherable by others, such as those found in [Trithemius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Trithemius)' [*Polygraphia*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygraphia_(book)). In such cases, having someone else write for you can provide better concealment. Be cautious, as using indecipherable ciphers may raise suspicion and lead to interception, unless you are a skilled writer.

### Giving Gifts and Favors

Be generous in giving what you know others will not ask for, or what they will never use, such as privileges.

A teacher should not teach his student everything he knows, in order to maintain the student's desire to learn more.
Similarly, a parent should not give their child so much that the child no longer needs or hopes for anything more from the parent.
The same principle applies to a master's relationship with his servant.

If lands are given, they should be chosen to make the recipient dependent on the giver's goodwill. This can be done by selecting lands lacking essential resources like wood, water, or mills.

If a contract or deed is drawn up, a clause should be included making it revocable at the giver's discretion.

If someone is worthy of a public office and declines your offer, do not allow him to refuse, unless his refusal is made public. Otherwise, people may believe that you did not adequately recognize or reward their merits.
To prevent the person from making excuses, appoint him when the position requires immediate attention, and be absent during this time, so that he is forced to accept the appointment and begin his duties.

Grant favors in a way that costs you nothing. This can be done by forgiving penalties that are due or by not imposing new and unjust taxes, even if your neighbors do so.

The things you use yourself, such as weapons, horses, rings, should not be too costly, so that you can give them away as a great gift at little cost to yourself.

When giving gifts, avoid common methods. For instance, to give a rifle, have a contest with a prize for hitting a target, then give it to the winner as if already victorious. You can certainly decide on the matter, or rig the game.

If you wish to give something pleasing to a particular person, do not promise it in advance, because he may feel obligated to decline it politely or feel indebted to you for the gift.

Those who praise their own possessions in front of others are inviting them to ask for those things.

Avoid hastily criticizing the practices established by your predecessors, as they may have foreseen issues that you have not yet considered[^chesterton].

[^chesterton]: This principle is now famous as [Chesterton's fence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Chesterton%27s_fence).

Likewise, do not readily grant perpetual favors, because it may be necessary to change them later, and you will no longer be able to do so.

Do not appear to throw away gifts, nor try to increase their value so that they may be pleasing.

Consider what needs compel someone to act and when those needs arise.

If you have helped someone, do not mention it to anyone else, as it may offend him and seem like you are reproaching him. And if you are forced to mention it, say it was a debt, and that you do not need or wish to accept thanks for it.

If something is given to you (even if very small), take care not to be ungrateful.

### Asking for Things

When asking a friend for a favor, make sure your request doesn't require too much money or effort.
Instead of directly asking, letting them know that you need help should suffice. If your friend does not provide the favor voluntarily, he will not do so even if you ask directly.
However, express gratitude for all help provided, as this will subtly convey your desire for further assistance.

If you are about to request something serious, first discuss other matters and subtly explain your desires as if doing something else.

Be cautious when asking nobles for favors, as they may perceive your request as a command.
Seek the help of illustrious people to advocate for you, such as a child asking their parent for a favor, but avoid involving those who have the same need as you.

The best time to ask for a favor is when someone is happy, such as on a feast day or after a meal, but not while they are drowsy, distracted by other business, or tired.

Do not presume to ask for many things at once.

When advocating for someone, treat them as if you don't know them. Limit your interactions with them to demonstrate that your support is based on the merits of their cause rather than personal benefit.

When persuading others, tailor your arguments to their interests and values: emphasize potential gains or losses for those motivated by wealth, appeal to religious beliefs for the devout, offer praise to the young and ambitious, and highlight social pressure for those concerned with their reputation.

Avoid asking a leader for special favors or legal permissions, as these requests are often granted slowly. Instead, wait for the right moment and present the necessary paperwork ready for their signature.

Do not ask someone for a rare item they cherish, especially if you have no genuine use for it.
If he refuses, he will feel guilty for disappointing you and start hating you, as people often resent those they have wronged.
If he agrees, he may view you as an imprudent requester and avoid you in the future.

To avoid the shame of rejection, only make requests when you are confident they will be granted. Therefore, it is better to explain your need without directly asking for anything.

Conceal your strong desire for something until you have obtained it. To do this, either feign indifference or imply that you believe it has already been promised to someone else, and then congratulate them.

If something is denied to you, secretly send another to request it for himself, from whom you will more easily obtain the thing.

If someone wants to snatch an honor that you seek from you, send someone to him who will dissuade him in the name of friendship by highlighting the difficulties attached to the task.

### Admonishing

To reprimand someone without them realizing it, begin by discussing unrelated topics. Then, subtly exaggerate and criticize the actions you want to address.
To obscure the fact that you are reprimanding them, add other details to the conversation. Additionally, frequently encourage them to be positive and cheerful, and include some jokes to lighten the mood.
If they become sad, inquire about the reason. After discussing their emotional state, add all the other points you want to make at the end, even discussing potential solutions in a general sense.

If someone is aware that you suspect them of a certain vice, assign them to handle confidential matters, but without putting anything important at risk. To dispel your suspicion, they will execute the task with great dedication. Hence, it can sometimes be beneficial to appear suspicious.

Scolding stubborn young people who engage in forbidden actions will only encourage them further. Instead, wait for their remorse or for them to grow tired of their behavior.

If it happens that you must change tactics, do not abruptly shift from harsh to gentle.

When dealing with emotionally distant people, be direct and instill fear. However, when dealing with passionate people, proceed cautiously and gently.

### Avoiding Deception

Be cautious when trusting prudent men. They may minimize issues related to their own duties and be too generous when judging the reputations of others.
They will not reveal if anyone has spoken badly about you in their presence, nor whom you should be wary of, or what vices they themselves struggle with.
The same is true of priests when they praise their penitents, because they can say nothing but good about them, no less than parents about their children.

If you fear that someone may complain about you, cause trouble, or do something along those lines in your absence, keep them close to you. Engage them in activities under the guise of friendship, such as entertainments, hunting, dining, conversation, or military service.
Thus, to prevent neighboring nations from rebelling while you are engaged in another war, bring their leaders with you, accompanied by a small, trusted force, as if they were your most loyal allies.

It will be useful to have a mirror in front of you while you sit at table or write, so that you may see what is being done behind your back.

### Preserving Health

Avoid eating too little or too much, and ensure that your food is of good quality.

Dress appropriately for the weather, avoiding excessive heat or cold.

Avoid sleeping, working, or living in uncomfortable or stressful environments.

Do not spend too much time in high altitudes.

Overeating and irregular bowel movements are the sources of diseases. Engage in moderate physical activity and rest, and keep your emotions under control.

Do not dwell near swamps or even rivers.

The windows of your bedroom should face more to the North and East than to the South.

Avoid engaging in serious work for more than two hours at a stretch. Take regular breaks to relax and refresh your mind.

Consume well-prepared foods that can be obtained everywhere.

Engage in sexual activity moderately and do so according to your own physical needs, regardless of your marital status.

### Avoiding Envy

Avoid acting as a witness in disputes. Doing so will inevitably offend one side or the other.

Do not speak poorly of anyone, and do not show disdain through your gestures. If you make a scornful remark about someone, continue the conversation as if nothing happened.

In the presence of others, do not show special favor to anyone. If you do, those who are not favored will feel despised and begin to hate you.

Be cautious of sudden fame or glory, as people can become overwhelmed before they grow accustomed to it.

Do not criticize or condemn the vices or customs that are pleasing to the common people.

If you know the perpetrator of a hateful act, do not expose yourself to new hatred: avoid appearing to approve of the deed, taking glory in it, or mocking those who were harmed. Such actions greatly increase envy. It is better to be absent and remain silent about the deed.

Avoid introducing novelties in your attire, appearance, or the banquets you host.

When making laws, do not imply that some people lack virtue. Instead, compel all to act uniformly.

Provide explanations for your actions to satisfy everyone, but only after you have taken action, to avoid being obstructed or delayed[^hooper].

[^hooper]: [Admiral Grace Hopper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper)'s ["It's easier to ask forgiveness than it is to get permission."](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper#:~:text=magazine%20(July%201986)-,It%27s%20easier%20to%20ask%20forgiveness%20than%20it%20is%20to%20get%20permission.,-As%20quoted%20in)

Make it a universal principle to speak neither positively nor negatively about anyone, not even a little.
Do not report good or bad deeds, as the person you are speaking to may be a friend of the one you are discussing, and you may inadvertently offend them. Your words, possibly distorted and exaggerated, will eventually reach the person you are speaking about.
If you praise, perhaps the third party who hears will be less of a friend of the praised, and so he will become your enemy.
However, it is better to be well-informed by observing and listening carefully. Be discreet in your inquiries, as people may take offense if they realize you are seeking information about them. Gather knowledge in a way that does not look like you are seeking.

Be cautious of excessive generosity, as it may give the impression that you consider yourself superior to others. Similarly, if you claim to have an abundance of resources or support, it may seem that you do not value or need the help of others.

Avoid boasting that you will enforce the law more strictly and rigidly than your predecessors, as this may alienate friends. Even if you have the right to do so, only propose changes that you know will be well-received.

Do not give any servant authority over others or deal with them in a way that suggests you are acting together, especially if they are disliked.
Do not praise or reward servants unless their virtue is evident to all, as this may encourage others to emulate them.

If it becomes necessary to treat your people with severity, have others carry out the actions. Make it appear as though they are acting independently of your command. This way, if those affected complain, you can minimize the severity and blame those who executed it, as if they were solely responsible.
For example, if discipline is lax, allow others, officials or supervisors, to notice the need for correction and carry out harsh measures without specific instructions from you. They may resort to even harsher actions to avenge themselves, giving you the opportunity to show benevolence to those who appeal to you.

When someone else has earned glory through harsh actions, give them full credit. This way, you will receive the benefits without provoking envy. Doing so can also be seen as a form of glory.

Attribute your good outcomes and successes to the influence, guidance, or advice of others. Act as if you received their support and wisdom.
In success, claim nothing for yourself.

Let your interactions, table, and clothing remain the same. If changes are necessary, make them subtly and gradually.

If someone must be punished, either lead them to confess their own guilt or delegate the judgment to another person. Secretly order this person to pass a harsh sentence, which you can then soften to appear merciful.

Do not insult the vanquished, nor your antagonist, and even if you conquer someone, do not proclaim yourself the victor in deeds or words. Be content with true victory.

If you must make a decision that may provoke envy, use ambiguous language. Present arguments for both sides, emphasizing the one you prefer. However, appear to conclude in favor of the other side or avoid stating a conclusion altogether.

If someone asks you to intercede, promise to do so, but simultaneously indicate that the matter is not entirely within your control and that the outcome may not be favorable.

If vengeance is to be taken through another or an unknown person, order the injured party to grant pardon to the offender, but secretly allow the offender to flee as soon as possible.

If parents are quarreling, do not readily adhere to either side, but find business to be absorbed in, so you may be excused by both sides, and neither will know you are not on their side, even if you show no special friendship to either.

Do not be seen as the author of any new laws, especially adverse ones. Instead, attribute them to your superiors and the ruler.

Be rare in public, readily report trivial matters to your superior, and do not boast of his friendship.

If you notice you can do everything with the powerful, know that whatever sin they commit will be imputed to you. Therefore, ensure the ruler sees your advice, accepts your intercessions, but in your absence arranges the matter otherwise. This should be especially held by confessors of princes.

If your family lineage or ancestors are praised, divert the conversation elsewhere, so they may notice this modesty of yours. Then the praise will be safe without envy. If you seem too pleased, hatreds will arise.

Do not be a public praiser of those things which are pleasing and favorable.

And if it happens that you are removed from office, openly show that a favor has been done for you, a provision for your peace, and seek out reasons to demonstrate this. Thus no one will insult you.

One should not openly inquire who was an enemy or their supporters, nor institute a conversation about it, but it will be in your interest to know everything secretly.  

Do not deal openly with those who are hated by all, nor suggest advice to them.

Never let it be known you were in a council in which hated things are believed to be done even against enemies, although you can be the author from afar.

Do not find fault with anyone's deeds, do not criticize or inspect the duties of others. Avoid the places where others preside—such as fields, workshops, or stables—as well as places where they can see that they are being observed. Do not go to these places of your own accord.

Inquire very cautiously from servants and boys about their masters.

See that in your manners, gestures, gait, conversation, play, manner and phrasing of speech, laughter, fervor, there is nothing that can offend.

However you are occupied, if someone approaches, respond most pleasantly and show that he is a welcome guest to you. Excuse him now so he may have another occasion to approach you. To attend to the good of your peace, much will have to be yielded from your comforts.

However much someone tells false and unproven things, listen while he tells it to others. Do not correct him or show that you know better. And do not seem to despise them with jokes and mockery, even to accept them as jokes or so they can notice they are being eluded as vain.

Even if things go badly for some, do not ridicule them. Rather, strive to excuse, entreat, and help.

Do not act toward those not subject to you in ways that seem to be exerting jurisdiction.

### Uncovering Secrets

Engage even people of low status in conversation. Overcome by kindness, especially if you grease their palms with gold, they will likely tell you everything you want to know. (You can also gather information by talking with children, but this comes with certain risks.)

Set servants against each other, so they will betray each other's secrets.

However, it is crucial to always keep your promises to everyone. Failing to do so will cause them to lose trust in you.

Do not act on information without verifying it first.

### Discerning Intentions

First, examine a person's motives and assess whether they are consistent with their claimed actions, typical behavior, or the actions they are suspected of committing.
Additionally, note if the person is acting more passionately or more cautiously than they typically do.

If a person is not acting in their own interest, or if they abruptly and enthusiastically change their stance, it may indicate that they have been bribed.

If a person does not agree after their stated reasons have been thoroughly disproven, they are not genuinely motivated by those reasons.

Likewise, if someone offers excessively complex, subtle, implausible, unnatural, or trivial arguments while passionately advocating for a cause, it indicates that they are not acting in their own interest.

If an individual advocates for the same position on multiple occasions but offers different justifications each time, disregarding their previous reasons, it is likely because people often struggle to remember arguments that are not their own.

Send someone to approach the person confidently in the name of friendship and to frankly inquire about the cause. This will uncover the person's true motivations.

### Avoiding Offense

If you have been reluctant or less generous in granting someone's request, be careful not to be overly generous to others in a similar situation for some time afterward, even if it seems minor.
Otherwise, you will either arouse distrust towards yourself or incite hatred between the parties involved.

Never increase severity toward those you govern unless you also increase rewards or benefits at the same time; otherwise, you will either incur hatred or contempt. If you increase both severity and rewards, you will mix love with fear.

If you introduce something new that offends others or your superior, present it as a common occurrence, the widespread nature of the fault will lessen the animosity towards you.

If you are believed to be the source of an unpopular policy, openly perform good deeds among the people, such as reducing taxes or punishments, especially for those well-liked by the public.

If you are planning something unusual, first meet secretly with a theologian or another influential figure and win this person over to your side, so that they may publicly advise, promote, and even compel you to follow through with your plan.

When you are about to impose new laws, demonstrate their necessity and deliberate with the prudent about establishing them. Alternatively, let there be a rumor that you sought their counsel, making you appear more prudent.
You can then, ignoring their advice, impose other laws by your own judgment.

Do not procure a wife, maidservant, or other personal roles for anyone, or persuade them to a certain state of life.

Beware of acting as the executor of a will.

If you are in someone's retinue while he is organizing and commanding his household, be present indeed, but do not suggest or assist with the methods.

When someone comes to a new place, they may too freely praise the old ways and people. Be cautious not to fall into this common mistake.

Even if you personally disagree, follow the more lenient opinion in matters of conscience or other areas, while publicly advocating for the more stringent position.

In the presence of no one should you show that you have power over superiors or have obtained a favor.

Similarly, you should never reveal your opinion about another in any confidence.

Always please a superior by generating profit or benefits, regardless of your position.

It is better to be somewhat, or at least apparently, lax with subjects rather than strict.

If you hear that a presumed friend has spoken ill of you, do not reproach them. You will make an enemy of someone who, until now, was indifferent.

Do not wish to know all the secrets of the great. If it happens to be divulged from elsewhere, suspicion will oppress you.

If someone does something pleasing to you, such as congratulating or greeting you, show that it is most pleasing to you. Otherwise, you might not receive such gestures in the future.

If someone does not keep their word or deed as promised, do not reproach them. You will gain nothing but hatred.

As much as you can, allow yourself to be defeated by your lord in those games in which the contest is about glory, not about any loss to you. You are strong if you conquer others, even if you are conquered by your lord alone.

In whatever familiarity you may have with your lord, never forget reverence and submission. Otherwise, he will think that familiarity breeds contempt.

Do not boast that you have won someone over to your side by your counsel, even if he was willing. He will resist more in the future.

Do not insult the bad outcome of one who did not obey your counsel. Rather, excuse the person who carried out the action.

To one boasting of his wealth, strength, dexterity in leaping, counsel, aid—do not act in a way that suggests you are not enjoying it. If you know his ignorance, feign ignorance yourself.

If you have been gravely injured by a superior, not only do not complain, but do not even let him notice that you were injured, because they hate the one they have injured.

Praise even the smallest gifts as the greatest, if they come from your lord. Proclaim and show that you love then supremely.

Refuse dignities with your whole heart, and do not let many things be conferred on you that shine greatly but bring little utility.

### Encouraging Action

To encourage someone to act, take responsibility for any potential losses, such as goods or property, and offer specific rewards in return.

For example, before a battle, a commander should announce compensation for specific injuries, that he will cover their losses in goods and baggage; meanwhile, he should place a strong garrison in the camp, lest concern for it distract the soldiers' minds.

### Acquiring Prudence

As much as possible, be silent, listen to the advice of others, and carefully weigh it in your mind.

Take care not to be carried away by the passion of love.

Do not value your own words and deeds too highly.

Do not occupy yourself with useless matters that will be of no future use.

Do not entangle yourself in the affairs of others.

Freely give others credit for accomplishments, even if you have greatly contributed to the project. By doing so, you will receive even greater recognition in return, without inciting envy.

Beware of anger and revenge.

When the virtues of others are recounted, listen willingly.

Rarely marvel at rare things.

Give advice sparingly.

Do nothing simply to rival others.

Avoid lawsuits, even sometimes at your own loss.

Never show your valuable or highly desirable possessions to anyone.

If someone incites you to do something, see that they offer themselves as a partner in the risk.

Before making a request, offering advice, or undertaking any business, research similar cases and historical judgments to guide your decisions.

The rhetoricians should be reread from time to time. Study their suggestions to do such things as stirring up envy, retorting, excusing, and diminishing someone.

Strive for ambiguity in your statements, making your position appear clear to both parties without committing to a definite conclusion. This technique of double meaning, as employed by Aristotle according to [Nazianzus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregory_of_Nazianzus)[^aristotle], can be useful in various situations.
Use this technique in books, in tedious letters, and in advice, presenting arguments for both sides of an issue while minimally revealing your own position.
You can use a wide range of rhetorical techniques, in addition to using ambiguous language, to express your desires, make requests, or declare your affection.

[^aristotle]: Aristotle *did* write about the topic in his [Sophistical refutations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_ambiguity#:~:text=Aristotle%20writes%20about%20an%20influence%20of%20ambiguities%20on%20arguments%20and%20also%20about%20this%20influence%20depending%20on%20either%20combination%20or%20division%20of%20words%3A).

Allow others to criticize you, even if their claims are false. Do not defend yourself, as this will encourage them to continue. Instead, show appreciation for useful advice.
Ignore useless remarks, but acknowledge some, even if they are false. This will make you appear flexible and not overly concerned with being right all the time.

Train yourself to always be able to provide arguments for both sides of an issue; to accomplish this, study the techniques of rhetoricians and their methods of justification.

If you are an ambassador dealing with an enemy, document any gifts you receive from them and report it to your leader. This will protect you from suspicion of disloyalty. Apply this principle of transparency to other situations as well.

Do not send as an ambassador one who is averse to you, because he will give contrary advice and himself desires to rule.

Seek out diverse counselors, as it is rare to find well-balanced individuals. Have one cautious counselor, another passionate, one gentle, and another harsh. By consulting them, you will arrive at the best advice.

Always pay attention to who is gaining or losing favor, and ensure that servants of the ruler from the least to the greatest are on your side.

On each or certain days, have hours in which you premeditate how to act if this or that should happen.

To keep track of your relationships with servants and friends, maintain a ledger with a page for each person. This will help you address any grievances and recognize their contributions effectively.
Divide the page into four columns to record the following:

1. Note the losses received from that person, how often he failed in his duty.
2. What good you conferred on him with your labor.
3. What he accomplished for you.
4. What trouble he received from you, and what extraordinary labors.

Put these rules into practice each day in conversation.

Whether you receive correction from a superior justly or unjustly, always refrain from criticizing them in the presence of others and speak well of them.

As much as possible, promise nothing to anyone in writing, especially to women.

That which you are drawn to by the greatest passion and desire, avoid if you can, or at least adhere to it most cautiously.

Even if your affairs are on solid ground, it never hurts to take additional measures to secure them as much as possible.

Reflect on your own action after it has passed, and on another's - what it lacked, when it could have been seized, when it could have been better instituted, etc.

### Acting Cautiously

Being cautious involves two aspects: *cautious trust* and a certain *generosity*.
*Cautious trust* means being on guard even with friends, as some friendships exist to deceive, and trusting no one without reason to suspect them.
*Generosity*, in this context, means refraining from indiscriminately telling the truth or correcting others' errors and habits, while maintaining a pretense of doing so, although this is not entirely harmless.

Entrust a secret to no one, because anyone can become an enemy at any moment.

Do nothing when distracted by life's joys, or you will make mistakes and betray yourself.

Do not assume that anyone will interpret your actions favorably, as people who do so are exceedingly rare.

Entrust nothing to letters that you would not want read by a third party; in fact, put praises in them, so that they may come into their hands.

If someone tries to extract information from you by pretending to know it already, do not correct their errors.

Either conceal the vices of others or excuse them; hide your own feelings or pretend to have the opposite ones.

No matter how great a friendship may be, consider the possibility of hatred; in times of fortune, prepare for adversity.

If you are victorious, never return the noblest captives to the enemy. By holding them, you may compel the enemy to spare you if fortune turns against you, as they will seek the release of their own captured nobles.
Moreover, do favors for the leaders of your enemies and maintain correspondence with them, unless faced with an unavoidable and pressing situation that prevents you from doing so.

Avoid acting solely for the sake of appearances, unless you are prepared to justify your actions. People will condemn your deeds without waiting for an explanation, and in this era, even certain virtues are condemned, let alone questionable ones.

If inferiors and servants ask something of you, order them to leave it in writing for you, so that you may be able to inspect all the circumstances more closely. You, however, should give responses only orally.

When conversing in situations where your words may be used against you, preemptively claim that you often speak in jest, exploring contradictory ideas and occasionally being mischievous. This way, if you say something incautious, you can excuse it by reminding others of your earlier disclaimer.

If you find yourself pressured by games, hunting, and love or lust, and carried away by passions, forbid these activities to yourself altogether. Otherwise, you are likely to act incautiously in many situations.

When dealing with infants, the elderly, the stubborn, those with unstable memory, or tyrants, act as much as possible in the presence of witnesses.

Receive and request orders in writing.

Do not readily give advice to the more ferocious and impetuous; they judge by the outcome.

Where it is believable that you are being observed, speak very little; there is an easy lapse in many things.

In everything, observe vices and virtues, so that if there is need, you may be able to turn to one part or the other: those weapons will prove useful for many things.

Have shutters on the insides of windows, and let the part where they meet the windows be black, so that it cannot be discerned whether the window is closed or not.

### Getting Rid of an Unwelcome Guest

Arrange a signal with your servant beforehand. When they receive the signal, have them call you away as if for urgent business. They can whisper in your ear, send a messenger with letters, or announce that harm has been done or that there are disturbances among your subjects.

Have a doctor forbid you from speaking or drinking.

Have a saddled horse brought, as if you were about to depart.

Give oats to your guest's horses, but first shake a wolf skin over them, or provide a stable where a wolf's carcass has been buried.
This will make them restless.

Provide a bedroom with a specially prepared bed near windows that are kept open when it starts raining.
Block the fireplace so that it smokes, and light the furnace before offering the room.

### Conversing with Others

Know yourself and from what background you come.

Some people may seem unpleasant to talk to at first, but as you spend more time with them, their wisdom becomes apparent, making the conversation more agreeable.
Others may appear prudent and learned at first, but over time, they may prove to be flawed in their judgment or without foresight.
Adapt your interactions based on the type of person you are dealing with. If someone's wisdom emerges gradually, engage in fewer but longer conversations. If they are immediately prudent and learned, interact with them often but briefly, in a way that you find pleasing.

Be a rare guest, lest you become commonplace.

Consume material and engage in conversations about topics that others are passionate about, such as statues, weapons, or poetry, and praise their interests.

Avoid interacting with someone who is distracted by other matters, as they will be less attentive to you.

When interacting with those who are prone to melancholy, be serious. When dealing with those who are easily angered, be assertive and patient. This is especially important if you are in a subordinate position.

Do not put on an air of seriousness or solemnity.

When speaking with the learned or those experienced in business, be concise and avoid excessive explanations. On the contrary, when interacting with the uneducated, you may need to provide more detailed explanations.

Be mindful of the timing of your interactions, and whether they are appropriate.

Seek to befriend those who hold influence, either through their alliances or by getting in their favor by any means necessary.

Be prepared for every situation. For example, if someone challenges you with a comment in a gathering, plan a way to respond calmly with sharp words while maintaining a composed outward demeanor.

If you must speak of someone not present, avoid mentioning their name, location, or any identifying details, in case a passerby overhears and guesses the subject of your conversation.

Never repeat information that is hard to explain or may be perceived as false, even if it is entirely true.

Treat everyone with respect, as if they were your superiors.

Be sincere about things that, if revealed, will neither harm nor benefit you. For example, be honest about genuine virtues that have been entrusted to you, rather than false ones.

Beware of conversing with those who show themselves venal and ready to commit any crime for you, because they will likely turn against you.

Avoid the furious and the desperate, as such interactions can be fraught with danger.

When interacting with rulers, always be concise; they prefer to be listened to rather than to listen. In these situations, be thoughtful and measured in your speech, rather than overly eloquent. Regardless of your familiarity with them, always show reverence.

Give the first seats to the elderly, submit to their admonitions, praise and revere them, for they readily accuse.

Praise and show respect to the boastful.

When dealing with the uneducated, try to understand their situation and mindset.

Limit your interactions with talkative people, those who have everything in their mouth.

Diligently praise what someone loves and ignore what he hates. Acting to the contrary, even unwittingly, will offend.

When interacting with individuals, act as if they were the only friend you have.

### Joking

Avoid obscene words or actions, as these are the habits of foolish people. Similarly, refrain from mimicking the sounds of birds or other animals.

Never make jokes about things that would embarrass the other person, such as their physical or personality flaws, as these will leave a negative lasting impression.
Furthermore, avoid speaking about the misfortunes of others, whether they are present or not. It is better to listen to such stories than to tell them.

To engage in honest and pleasant conversation, read authors who tell captivating stories and even poets, so that you may learn to express a range of emotions in your interactions.

Never act too freely or commit anything reprehensible in another's presence, no matter how close the relationship.

### Avoiding Ambushes

Stage a quarrel with a friend to trick your enemy into believing that you are genuinely at odds with each other. This may prompt your enemy to reveal their true feelings as they attempt to exploit the situation. Then, suddenly resist and oppose the enemy with your friend's combined strength.

This tactic can also be used against robbers planning an ambush on the road or in similar situations. Intentionally make yourself appear vulnerable and approach the ambush site. When the trap is sprung, flee and lure your attackers into a counter-ambush.

If the person setting the ambush is powerful, choose your words diplomatically to avoid provoking them into taking open action against you. Seek a middle ground in your responses to avoid falling into their traps while not revealing that you noticed the deceit.

If others are urging you to take an action that may be harmful to you, feign enthusiasm and make preparations to comply, as long as the preparations are not too complicated or demanding. Meanwhile, secretly plan to do the opposite of what they suggest.

### Managing Wealth

Do not despise small gifts and be attentive to losses.

Avoid being wasteful with resources, such as allowing bread, food, or horse feed to go to waste.

Confer with skilled financial advisors and learn their methods.

Consider what can be sold, planted, or produced from your lands. Employ craftsmen to help you achieve these goals.

Know your entire income and always have an eye on your affairs.

Before incurring expenses, consider how you can recover an equal amount, so that you don't lose money overall.
For example, if you decide to give four thousand scudi[^scudi] to valiant soldiers, you should first announce monetary penalties for gamblers and similar vices. This way, the expenditure can be offset by the income from these penalties.

[^scudi]: The [scudo (plural scudi)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_scudo) was a large Italian gold or silver coin. Its value varied depending on the period and issuing state, but one or two dozen scudi would be a yearly salary for many professions.

Avoid owning expensive utensils that deteriorate with use or lose their value. If you need to sell these items, you will receive little in return.
Instead, only possess enough to suit your status, such as silver vessels, where the craftsmanship is more valuable than the material itself.

Try this method to catch a steward's dishonesty: A few hours later after he has provided an account, pretend to have forgotten and ask him to repeat the same information from memory. If the information is false, his answers will be inconsistent.

### Gaining and Conferring Offices

First, advise that it would be necessary to bestow offices to someone who fits the description of your accomplishments and circumstances.
Then, humbly decline the position, as if you were already in a similar one.

Strive for good and clear counsel and do many things that are pleasing to the public, such as the construction of public buildings, providing aid to the poor, and implementing measures that can be done without suddenly increasing taxes.

Do not assume that your talents and worthiness automatically qualify you for any duties, as if these duties must necessarily be conferred upon you and as if there were no one else equally suitable.
Those in power prefer to confer duties on the unworthy rather than on talented and worthy men.

Instead, act as if these duties were to be granted by the favor of a patron.
Offer your services graciously and promise obedience.
Seek intermediaries to support your case and avoid making empty promises
Humble yourself, openly express your unworthiness, and express your deepest gratitude.

If you hold an office that requires a powerful person, and there is no one more powerful than you, permanently allocate all of the office's revenues. This way, anyone who seeks the office must bring their own strength to it, rather than finding strength in the office itself, ensuring that the office will remain with your house.

Always strive for the highest things, so that if you study, study as much as you can, even spurning that boasting of talent which some learned men wish to seem to have in their studies.
If you seek virtues, seek them to the highest degree possible. Attain the greatest dignities you can, and thus establish yourself firmly in all positions.

Do not grant the administration of goods permanently, but for a three-year term, so that if someone has increased the goods and managed things more peacefully, confirm them in the same position, lest security breed negligence.

While fortune favors you, make the most of it, because it can easily change. While you are fortunate, seek what you can. Display mildness, anger, and rewards as needed, anticipating higher positions.

### Responding to Requests

When presented with a request, do not refuse immediately. Instead, engage in some discussion before refusing. Once you have refused, stand firm in your decision. Only concede for serious reasons.

When you are about to refuse a request, take a moment to consider it, then pretend to be sorrowful.
Alternatively, arrange for letters to be brought to you or have someone announce sad news. To achieve this, instruct a trusted servant to give you a predetermined signal, indicating through gestures and words that you are unable to fulfill the requester's desire.

Praise the requester's request, and if they persist in asking, take time to deliberate how you can demonstrate your affection toward them.

Entrust the requests to a previously instructed servant, teaching the servant how to handle the matter as if it were their own.

If you refer the requester to another person, show the requester how to approach that person to ensure they do not leave empty-handed.

The common people are impulsive by nature. If they ask for something unjust, do not refuse immediately. Instead, put them off with persuasive reasons and some favors. However, if they desire something that benefits you, do not delay in granting it, as their opinion may quickly change.

Allow yourself to accept someone's hatred, as people are more genuine in their hatred than in their love.

If you cannot refuse to grant someone an office, assign them a position that brings danger to themselves without disturbing the administration of the army. Disguise this as an honor, similar to how the Romans retained men in the court with honorary duties.

Establish a set time each year, or at least every three years, to review a written record of your subordinates or employees. During this review, dismiss some from their positions, promote others, distribute rewards or favors, and listen to their requests or concerns.

Announce that if anyone makes a request directly to you, you will grant it. However, if they arrange the request through others, deny it. Announce that in the future, all indirect requests will be denied.

### Managing Emotions

Compile examples of emotions and expressions from poetry, such as those found in the [*Palatium Eloquentiae*](https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_HSr-RWjM08YC)[^poem], and practice the ones you need until you have mastered them.

[^poem]: Most likely [Louis II de Bourbon, Prince of Condé](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis,_Grand_Cond%C3%A9)'s [*Reginae Eloquentiae Palatium sive Exercitationes Oratoriae*](https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_HSr-RWjM08YC) (which roughly translates to *Palace of the Queen of Eloquence or Oratorical Exercises*).

Trust no one, not even your closest friend. When interacting with others, you may pretend to trust them, but always maintain control over your facial expressions and words when showing affection. Remember that your face can reveal as much as your words.

Overcome your own timidity, so that even in moments of self-doubt, you can still act as boldly as you have in similar circumstances.

### Feasting

When hosting a feast, focus on items that can be preserved, such as candied fruits, decorative wax figurines, ornate fountains, artificial mountains, and self-playing musical instruments.

Include artistic elements that are fitting for the occasion, such as wax candelabra covers bearing the coats of arms of your guests, colorful drinks, scented beverages that seem imported from afar, and artificial wines like those described by [Arnaldus de Villa Nova](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnaldus_de_Villa_Nova).

Present flowers, colored lettuces, giant eggs made from several smaller eggs and seasoned with spices, candles burning from ice, fragrant fires, vomiting mountains, fountains sprinkling snow, and fake fragrant fruits or apples brought to the table on their branch - all things which can grow in your garden at little expense.

Mix fruits in bottles and clusters. Even simple vegetables should be presented as if they were exotic, imbued with vibrant colors and flavors.

Prepare meats in various and rare ways, of which [Apicius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apicius) offers very many. Remember, at the table, it is not what is praiseworthy, but what is rare that is esteemed.

Likewise, mix live crabs with cooked ones, counterfeit meats with bones made from flour, fish made from meats pressed in wooden molds, syrups poured in place of broth, and have a wheel made of ice that falls apart on its own.

Some things should appear, spontaneously change color, disappear, and then reappear.

Serve cheeses in various forms and seasonings.

Even the vessels in which dishes are carried can be made from unusual materials, such as imitation gems.

### Avoiding Losses

Pay attention to even the smallest issues. Have your agents immediately report to you any potential sources of harm, so that you can take action before it occurs. Furthermore, ask them to suggest preventive measures.

The rates for buying and selling things should be observed, and experts should be consulted about unknown matters.

Each week, have the steward report on what has been accomplished.

After everyone has gone to bed, assign one person to check that the house is locked and note who is absent.

If you hold any office, record all expenses and income in the accounts with complete honesty, regardless of how generous your superior may have been.

### Acting in a Novel Way

Consider four things before acting in a novel way:

1. Consider whether it will be more beneficial or harmful to you?
2. Ask yourself if you possess the necessary abilities or talents?
3. Consider whether it aligns with your current status?  
4. Consider whether you are respected in your current role? And in the role you aspire to?

### Negotiating Shrewdly

When betting on an outcome, place an equal bet with another person on the opposite result. This way, regardless of the actual outcome, you will not incur any net loss.

When drafting onerous contracts, incorporate ambiguous terms that allow for broad or narrow interpretation.
For example, upon a city's surrender, promise to preserve everything if no uprising occurs, without specifying publicly or privately whether this applies to your own soldiers or the city's inhabitants.
If necessary and fairness demands, you can later reject the agreements.

When making promises, include conditional phrases such as "if you perform this or that to my satisfaction" or similar stipulations. This way, it will be easy to find a reason to void the promise by claiming that the conditions were not met to your satisfaction.

### Covering Mistakes

If you stumble in speech or act thoughtlessly, pretend it was deliberate, to test the judgment of others, or that you misspoke while trying to express something else. Smile as if you achieved your intended goal, or grieve as if you did not.

If you have made a mistake due to ignorance, do not ask others about it in a way that reveals your lack of knowledge or error. Plan ahead on how you would seek the truth or ask for others' opinions on what they would do in a similar situation. Be sure to conceal your own opinion to avoid being perceived as ignorant.

If you have forgotten something you said (which also happens to those not pretending), be careful not to accidentally contradict yourself. It is helpful to have noted the main points you stated.

Be most cautious when attempting to confuse others, as you may accidentally reveal either your ignorance or true intention. Therefore, plan for both potential outcomes beforehand.

### Stirring Hatred Against the Wicked

When in the presence of someone whose favor your target seeks or enjoys, praise your target in a way that may turn into an offense to their benefactor.
Emphasize that you are not expressing your own opinion, mentioning that what you said is commonly rumored. Imply to the benefactor that he should be concerned about his own reputation and that the reputation of those close to them is also at risk. Simultaneously, urge the benefactor to disregard rumors and let trivial matters fade away. However, ensure that they still feel the issue at hand concerns them.

Praise the person as if sympathizing with their pains, with a plaintive voice, exaggerating their position and its consequences as if defending it. Say he is outstanding but blemished by a vice, which you are not allowed to mention.

Never threaten one you intend to harm, for he will take precautions. Instead, pretend you are unequal and unable, even if you wished to harm them.

Draw your enemy back into friendship with you and engage them in feasting to lower their guard. Have hidden witnesses present when you speak, so that they may record anything he might inadvertently say against the ruler or others. This will provide material for an accusation.

Exaggerate the deed of an enemy and emphasize the evils that will follow unless he is punished. Meanwhile, to appear less motivated by passion, argue against punishment, but do so ineffectively, and as if saying that hatred must be cast from a distance.

Your enemy's character and deeds must be interpreted, and when the occasion allows, they must be driven into ruin with faltering steps.

Never attack many at once, but form friendships with others in the meantime.

Always secure your own affairs before attacking those of others, and do not indulge in revenge or neglect occasions for conducting your own business.

### Dissolving Friendships

When ending a friendship, never abruptly break it off, as if you suddenly hate the person due to a perceived slight or offense.
Instead, having reconciled and showing fervent love, gradually withdraw. To allow the friendship to gently dissolve, gradually reduce the frequency of your meetings. If you must meet, keep the conversations brief and invite them to dinner, acting as if you are burdened by business. This way, it won't seem like you were only pretending to be their friend until you decided to cast them out.

If he seems to rely on the goodwill of a powerful benefactor, advise him to ask for something so precious that the benefactor would never agree to part with it. When he is inevitably refused, emphasize how such a minor request was denied, exaggerating the incident as if occupied with other matters.

Persuade him to borrow things from a friend that he will likely damage, such as horses for a long journey or clothing for a feast, at a time when the friend will need those items for their own use. Thus, whether harm is done or not, the result will be the same.

Alternatively, suggest that he borrow items from his friend without specifying a time for their return. This way, he will harm himself with the task of reminding the friend or returning the items. Let him be ashamed to meet the other, and so the friendship will gradually cool.

Spread rumors that he relies entirely on his friend's advice and can do nothing independently. Go as far as suggesting that his friend takes care of his house, even his household. Point out his burdens, and so they will meet less often and drift apart.

Alternatively, arrange for a friend to entrust him with a secret, and then secretly spread that information to others. In this way, he will consider his friend's trustworthiness suspect.

### Praising Others

Pretend to be frank, acting as if you speak and act based solely on your own judgment and for the public good, hating nothing more than flattery.

Excuse someone's gentleness and mercy as a duty of piety, to weaken their strictness and severity.

Avoid praising someone in a way that openly criticizes others, except perhaps in a crowd with many confused voices.

Leave people's virtues unpraised and overlook their vices.

### Preventing Someone from Declining a Duty

If the person objects or makes an excuse, assure them that you will respect their wishes if it becomes evident that assigning them this duty was not in their best interest.

After you have departed, leave behind letters announcing the person's new position. Instruct that these letters be read on a specific date. If the person writes letters back to you, do not respond to them.

If they complain, reassure them by saying that they will hold the office for only a short time and will be relieved of their duties soon if it seems appropriate.

Exaggerate the person's efforts to help them demonstrate their merits and protect them from the jealousy of others.

Finally, declare that this office is given only to those destined for greater roles, and whose virtue is beyond reproach.

### Controlling Anger

Do not be quick to anger at anyone. Often, you will find that the matter was reported maliciously, or that you misunderstood it. If you act out of anger, the harm will remain with you.

If someone wrongs you, it is best to conceal your true feelings. Quarreling only leads to more conflicts and disrupts peace. Even if you emerge victorious, the consequences will be more severe than if you had been defeated, and you will attract more opposition.

Respond to those who criticize or oppose you in the best way possible, sometimes speaking ironically or maliciously. Respond candidly to their words, not to their intention, and meanwhile pretend to be occupied with other cares.

If someone accosts you on the road, without naming you directly, but denouncing a deed you are suspected of, strongly condemn the deed and the wickedness of those who commit such acts. Pretend to be unaware of any involvement or feign misunderstanding and respond about entirely different matters.
But if he names you, act as if he were not seriously rising up against you, but feigning anger. Then add humorous remarks that do not insult him, but rather put him in a cheerful mood. Alternatively, criticize yourself alongside him as if there were a third party involved, and you would complain more than he would.
And after they have left off, show by lighter means how futilely those things, though excellently denounced, were exaggerated, and how trivial the cause is.

If someone receives you in an inappropriate manner, conceal your resentment and act as if you had been received honorably. Thus, his rudeness will be its own punishment and a source of confusion for him. He may then try to compensate for his error by showing kindness.

If someone openly criticizes newly bestowed offices, defending their cause will demonstrate your nobility. Praise the merits of long-standing lineage, and apply the same reasoning to other cases.

If you are openly insulted, so that there is no place for dissimulation, have a ready humorous response, or begin a story that is somewhat relevant to the matter, through which a path may nevertheless be prepared for other discussions to follow.

Have someone prepared to present letters to you at a predetermined signal for such situations. After reading the letters, mention that an amusing incident has occurred, to which you are unexpectedly called to attend.

Allow the offender time to recognize the inappropriateness of their actions on their own. However, refrain from pointing out this realization to them, as it may be perceived as an attempt to provoke their anger.

Anger may also arise if someone firmly resolves to complete a task within a certain time, and something interferes with their plans. Beware of making such resolute commitments.

### Fleeing

Carry acid, such as burnt wine, and use it to drench clothes stuffed with straw. Suspend these clothes to create a diversion. The guard will believe you acted out of desperation and, neglecting his watch, will spread word to the others. Seize this opportunity to escape.

Feign illness by eating red ochre to simulate bloody stools, pressing near your elbow to alter your pulse, or inducing pallor. Then request that a doctor be summoned. Complain of being fatigued by insomnia. Request to be transferred to the guard's house and to dine with him that day. Ask for a sleeping draught, which you will introduce in your host's drink.

While preparing for escape, tell your companions you plan to fight your way out with a sword, so that if any of them are questioned by pursuers, they will dash their hopes of catching you easily.

Leave a bloody sword on the road or clothing by a riverbank, as if you had thrown yourself into the waves.
Or persuade your comrades to retreat to safety, and when you are alone, burn down the isolated house you are in, as if you had perished in the flames.

Have a docile horse, double its shoes affixed with nails, and bring durable provisions.

Never inquire about a single escape route, but several at once. When others are around, plan for the escape route you least intend to take. Likewise, when leaving cities and villages, first go into the fields, then change your clothing, cloak, and appearance, and return to a different route than the one you initially took.

If the pursuers are pressing close, leave behind a wounded horse. When it falls into their hands, they will suspect you have been killed. Leave your cap floating in a river or well, so that you may be believed drowned.

Carry a reversible horse blanket with different colors on each side, allowing you to change its appearance as needed. Additionally, bring a mask molded from hide, painted with a different face on each side, so that you can assume them as you please.

### Punishing and Correcting

Do not strike with your own hand, lest you be seen as cruel.

If you need to severely punish someone but lack strong justification, consider this approach: First, punish them for a mild offense that you would typically forgive. The offender will resent it and begin to complain and grumble.
When punished again, he will renew his complaints, until as if obstinate, he will give greater cause for a greater punishment, having been found guilty of a serious offense.

Young people can sometimes be further provoked by punishment. Therefore, allow them some controlled outlets that satisfy their desires without encouraging them to seek out additional or similar activities. These outlets should be self-contained and not lead to further temptations.

If you have removed someone from your household, court, or office, and others take it badly, do the following: Spread a rumor and openly express regret, claiming that you finally realized the person was influencing you to the detriment of your subjects, particularly those who lament his downfall. Assure everyone that their affairs will now improve.
To substantiate your claims and build trust, take concrete actions. For example, if you removed a steward, ensure that the wages he was responsible for are immediately paid.

Be generous with justice when it doesn't harm your interests, such as when a regional ruler oppresses their subjects. If the public good demands it, let the favor be remembered, so that the subjects may feel indebted and obliged to bear some burden willingly.

If you wish to correct someone, discuss potential solutions with him. He will find the solutions he comes up with himself most agreeable. Similarly, let him choose his own punishment.

When investigating, do not act confrontational. Deceive when you can without harming yourself and refrain from insulting the well-born.

To carry out a punishment discreetly, give the offender letters to deliver to your agent or letters of recommendation for others. In these letters, secretly include instructions for the offender's punishment.

If you wish to lead someone back to the right path, put him in charge of correcting in others the very vice with which he himself struggles. For example, a drunkard should exact punishment from other drunkards.

If someone humbles himself sufficiently and publicly, spare him, lest by despair you drive him to worse. Nor compel him to that which the guilty party will most refuse. Be content with a moderate vengeance.

After a moderate punishment has been decreed, one should wait to see if perhaps the situation improves.

When you confront the guilty, do not show that you have cut off all avenues for them, so that no one becomes enraged by having their crimes judged without a hearing. Show that you are naturally inclined to be merciful.

### Quelling a Sedition

When dealing with a group, never allow more than one person to address you at a time. Instead, let the group choose a single representative from among themselves.

Inquire into the causes of an uprising. If it is due to usury, lend without interest yourself.

Offer great rewards to whoever quells the sedition, suggests a way to resolve it, eliminates the ringleaders, or betrays them.

If the people are rebellious or unruly, they must above all be guided towards virtue by good men. Instilling the fear of God and piety is essential, as these alone will make them more compliant.

Spread false rumors accusing the instigators of the factions of secretly seeking private gain and dominion at the expense of the people's well-being and lives. Emphasize that they will not benefit from their actions.

### Being Praised

Be cautious not to let praise lead to comparisons or claims of being unique, even if true, as such statements are rarely believed.

If someone openly praises you in the presence of the Prince, ponder whether they have secretly accused you.
When you receive excessive praise, be cautious. If all your actions are praised, you are thanked for everything, and you are favored above others, be highly suspicious of these flatteries, as it may be a trap.

Avoid boasting about all your capabilities, as it will only serve to inform your adversaries.

If you wish to spread your glory through books, such as those that contain panegyrics, do so with a booklet that is easily purchased and can be esteemed in various parts of the world.
Ensure that the authors of such works are well-known beforehand, and that they include your name and praises; for these will spread your fame more than a large volume that no one will buy or read.

### Maintaining Inner Peace

Avoid setting strict deadlines for accomplishing tasks, as unforeseen circumstances may arise, causing you to either neglect other matters or become distressed if you are unable to meet your goal.

Understand that your subordinates are likely to make mistakes; therefore, avoid over-planning.

Disregard the complaints of your subjects about you.

If entrusted with a secret, either decline to accept it or keep it strictly confidential.

Avoid accepting responsibility for others' money or belongings.

When dealing with men you suspect of being talkative, stick to customary greetings and small talk.

Avoid promising to intercede on someone's behalf; if your efforts are unsuccessful, you will be troubled.

Do not personally oversee the work of craftsmen.

Have no dealings with complainers, groaning women, and the obstinate.

If you must go to places that you dislike, refuse to conduct business there. Instead, act as if the places were meant for other purposes.

### Disregarding Criticism

People are most deceitful when it comes to giving praise or mockery, flattery or taunts.

Collect written satires or mocking texts about you and read them yourself. Also, have others read them and laugh at them, this will cause the author to despair.

Do not reveal a satirical piece written against you. If it must be revealed, invent a reason for doing so.
However, if the satirical piece must be displayed, take the following steps: read it often at home, learn to laugh at it, and assume appropriate emotions. Imagine that you are mocking it, pretend to have objections, and premeditate fitting responses with an assumed emotion.

If something adverse happens, it should not always be concealed. Otherwise, the very act of concealment may convince others that the adverse event truly occurred.

### Acquiring Dexterity in Acting

When sympathizing with someone's suffering, console them using common expressions of support, without touching on anything that may offend them.

If someone is disparaged in your presence, be most cautious - neither praise nor condemn them. Both are odious.

Always speak well of your superiors, even if they have offended you. When someone else speaks ill of your superiors, do not agree or pretend to agree with them, even if it pleases you to do so.

You will detect the truth of those who accuse someone before you in this way: Listen to the accusers orally and note down the points, then order them to give these to you in writing. Say you are doing this so that the accusations can be directly presented to the accused person. Compare and you will know the truth.

### Averting Suspicion

Read the section titled *Gaining Favor*, *Avoiding Offense*, and *Acting Cautiously*.

If you are suspected of having slandered or discredited some accusers before the Prince, write letters praising them to the Prince, and ensure these letters reach *those who suspect you*.

Alternatively, if you wish to vex them, allow genuinely blank letters to be intercepted, making them suspect various secret writing techniques, such as the use of invisible ink that can be revealed by water or heat.

Another option is to write only the *first and last* syllables of each sentence. Then, openly express your hope that these letters do not reach the Prince's hands, so as not to appear as a flatterer.

### Deposing the Wicked

If you want to remove someone from their position, start by withholding the funds necessary for them to perform their key responsibilities. This will cause the person to incur debts. These debts can then be used as a pretext to justify their removal from office and subsequent punishment. Ensure that the debts are portrayed as illegitimate, so that the creditors themselves may demand repayment from the person, further pressuring them. Thus you have punished the person financially without trouble.

If the individual you want to remove is currently in the ruler's favor, entrust this individual with a sum of money or an item that the ruler or his wife cherishes. Remove the entrusted item from the person secretly by night, making it appear as a harmless prank or jest. At the same time, the ruler should be warned to beware of treachery, and that the servant has been corrupted. All these things must be planned in advance.

If you fear that the person you are removing, such as a general, may cause trouble, arrange for them to be discreetly detained while ensuring that their absence does not raise suspicion or alarm. Finally, hand over their army to an equal, give payment to the army from your own funds, lest they miss their lost general.

If someone argues too forcefully during a discussion or debate, claiming something false, have them write down and sign their opinion. This record can be used to challenge their argument later.

If you notice an arrogant and unqualified individual seeking your office (for example, if you are a general, as this type is especially prone to rivalry), take the following actions: provoke the enemy, create difficulties for the proud man, while still ensuring that you have sufficient provisions for yourself and your fortress.
Pretend to be distracted by another war and suggest that he should replace you in your position. Do not give him an account of the war, the places, or the enemy. As a result, he will encounter difficulties. Do not rush to his aid until he acknowledges both his own shortcomings and your greater expertise and authority.

If you need to manipulate some young people and make them more compliant, encourage them to engage in activities like singing, painting, and sculpting, which will divert their attention and make them more pliable. Assign them tutors who are desperate servants, lacking in honesty, entirely corrupt, and prone to indulging the desires of youths rather than guiding them properly.
Likewise, assign unscrupulous servants to those you wish to manipulate, enabling the servants to take advantage of their employer's weakened and exposed state. Similarly, send lazy and ineffective subordinates to a lazy and ineffective superior.

Arrange for an unknown person to send fabricated letters that appear to be written by the targeted individual's friend. Ensure that these letters are misplaced, as if through the bearer's carelessness, so that they may be read by many. This will undermine the targeted individual's affairs and reputation.

Overwhelm the targeted individual with numerous tasks simultaneously, ensuring that he accomplishes nothing of significance. Persuade him to seek and ask for many things.

Kill the animals he cherishes by feeding them foods laced with pepper or saffron, which will make them rabid.
Secretly administer drugs to the horse he is about to ride, so that when he mounts the horse, it becomes furious.

Propose immense rewards for him to enter, for instance, the lion's den - you will see him fall into an evidently dangerous situation.

### Traveling

Never reveal how much money you have to anyone. If strangers ask about your wealth, always claim to have very little.

Deceive potential thieves as much as you can, and tell no one which direction you are heading. To further conceal your route, ask different people for directions and get varying answers.

Beware of joining quarrelers, as they often start fights to distract and rob those who get involved. If someone taunts you, hide your true feelings and remain calm.

Be cautious about trusting those who are dressed splendidly, as if they are of noble blood. Unless you have other information about them, they may be thieves in disguise.

Before getting into bed or eating, carefully examine your surroundings with a light.

Do not employ the servants of the host to attend to you, as they may use this opportunity to spy on your belongings.

Always carry a book with you to pass the time.

Travel with trustworthy companions, and let them lead the way rather than follow behind you.

In slippery and mountainous places, it is useful to employ iron tools and walk on the tips of the feet.

Be brief in your speech, as saying too much may jeopardize your wealth or your life.

Oxen proceed more safely than horses through mountains.

### Avoiding Vain Pursuits

When dealing with a serious matter, let others focus on trivial aspects like applause and glory.

If an enemy wishes to surrender a city, offer them the most honorable conditions. Make them believe they are doing you a favor rather than being conquered. Let them depart with their banners unfurled and provide them with all the symbolic trappings of victory. In exchange, ensure that they yield the lands, hand over the captives, and leave behind the gold and fortifications before sunset.

This principle also applies to matters valued for their intricacy or diversity, such as artistic or creative works. Let others have these things as a reward, but do not seek them for yourself.

Never warn others of their wrongdoings if it may cause you harm, even if they promise gratitude in return. Words are worth only as much as the air they are made of. They are forgotten at once, while the consequences of your actions always remain with you.

Let others have glory and renown without you; seek power alone for yourself.

If you are promoted to a prominent position, be sure to also promote someone you fear may cause trouble. Let them enjoy the prestige of the office, but not its tangible benefits or power.

### Arguing and Correcting

Avoid criticizing someone when they expect praise or are expressing gratitude.

Praise even the smallest deeds, as this encourages diligence.

It is best to admonish someone through a mutual friend, in a confidential manner.

If someone is involved in illicit loves and you wish to help them break free, keep them occupied with challenging tasks and responsibilities.

Discreetly arrange for others to criticize the person's words or deeds. Have them report their findings to you, provide false testimony, and disapprove of all the person's actions.

Pay attention to the people with whom a person associates and sever those connections.
Companions of the same gender should be associated with the person in this matter - men with men, women with women, as the opposite sex has proven harmful.
Assign companions who, if not virtuous themselves, at least have opposing vices. For example, assign one companion who is fierce and another who is gentle, or some who are passionate and others who are calm.

### Managing Emotions

If you openly display strong emotions or personal feelings for too long, people will eventually oppose your actions.
Therefore, it is better to refrain from publicly displaying these emotions or behaviors.
Encourage others who genuinely feel the same way to do the same.

In the meantime, it is best to focus on serious matters to distract yourself from the emotions you wish to eliminate.

By doing so, you will conceal your true feelings of anger or happiness from even the most attentive observers.

### Avoiding Lending Money

When lending items, instruct the servant who is delivering them to provide a detailed receipt. Have the servant sign the receipt as if they were acting on their own behalf, without your knowledge.

If you cannot avoid lending money, consider the following options: claim that you are also in debt or do not have the full amount requested, and ask to borrow something of equal value in return; or explain that you can provide the money without interest if the person offers collateral.

If the borrower has assets that can be divided, suggest that their value will increase by the summer if they deposit a portion of them with you as collateral for the loan.

### Arriving at the Truth

To get an honest opinion about your actions, pretend that someone else is describing them, or read about your own deeds as if they were performed by another person. Then ask for opinions.

Remember that people have different views, and keep in mind that friends may be more forgiving in their evaluation.

If you receive measured praise, you can be more confident in the opinion's sincerity, giving some praise is considerate.
On the other hand, offering no praise, prying into the matter, and disapproving of everything about the deed is unkind.

### Accusing

Avoid being the first to accuse, and refrain from bringing a lawsuit against someone you know the judge favors more than you. Only proceed if you have noticed the judge's opinion shifting in your favor.

If you have brought a lawsuit, or one has been brought against you, even if your cause is most just, act as if it were extremely bad.

Approach and influence the judges with gifts, and your adversary through mediators who may meet with him.

Seek to premeditate each and all things which can be objected to you and what may be answered. Yet keep all those things most secret.

By no means be induced to show your rights or privileges to anyone, for you will give them something to notice and exploit.

Also recognize the nature of the one by whom you are accused - fierce or ignorant - so that you may know how to control yourself.
If fierce, choose a time when he is in a fervor. If ignorant, one must act slowly.

Ensure that the accused is unaware of the accusation and its cause. The accusation should come as a sudden surprise, which can unsettle even those well-versed in their own defense.

Also choose those who may promote your side, it matters little of what rank or appearance they are, provided that they are dear to the judge.
Involve them in the danger, showing that their own situation is at stake, so that they may persuade themselves that they cannot acquiesce except at their own extreme peril.

Furthermore, ensure that all accusations are presented not as a formal lawsuit, but as a friendly warning or confidential advice.

Include more severe allegations based on the judge's own vices. Since these allegations are true about the judge, they will believe them about the defendant as well. This will also make the judge aware that his own reputation, honor, and position are at risk.

In the presence of the judge, show mercy toward the defendant. Express that you are moved only by public evils and that you must denounce the case of an otherwise rightful friend, perhaps attributing their actions to misfortune.

### Being Accused

If you notice that someone has accused you, conceal your knowledge of the accusation and do not immediately change your behavior. This way, the informer cannot boast that their accusation was well-received by the Prince or superior they reported to.

Instead, when the opportunity arises, insinuate to the Prince that your accuser is an enemy and an informer. Suggest that informers, like traitors, are useful when needed but should never be truly trusted or loved.
Argue that if he maligns others in your presence, he will do the same to you in the presence of others, and that there is less prudence and harmony among those who are not allies, but rather critics of each other.
That even if the Prince finds such men useful, they will eventually reveal their true feelings towards him.

Approach the person who accused you and consult with them about how to handle the accusation, as if seeking advice from an intimate friend.

If he has spoken ill of you in the presence of another, trying to turn that person against you, speak favorably about a third person, with whom you are connected, in the presence of the same individual.

At the beginning of the dispute, expose the accuser as a co-conspirator or ensure that the trial is conducted in their presence, especially in matters that are agreeable to you, as was once done in military trials.

If you are accused of multiple offenses, do not deny everything, lest you forfeit all credibility. Acknowledge certain things, even if untrue, to avoid the impression that you are malleable and universally prone to mistakes.

If you know that you have been reported to your superior, it is often beneficial not to clear yourself unless your superior demands it. Defending yourself prematurely may provoke your superior further, so initially avoid doing so as much as possible.

### Visiting Provinces

First, when arriving in a new region, avoid keeping records that are easily readable by the locals. Instead, write any noteworthy observations, whether positive or negative, in a foreign language. This prevents locals from taking offense if they happen to come across your notes.

Second, observe all sacred objects in both public and private spaces, such as the interiors of temples, epitaphs, offerings, tombs of notable figures, and religious symbols and architecture such as organs, columns, and pulpits.
Additionally, examine fortresses, mountains, forests, valleys, and rivers, noting their characteristics, outpourings, sources, and the origins of their names.

Third, note the quality of the air, as that of Rome is not praised by newcomers, while that of Bologna and Padua is considered better. Also, observe the lengths of nights and days in each location.

Fourth, carefully observe the location and layout of cities, noting the orientation of each district. Pay attention to notable features such as metal mines, hot springs, ships, ceremonies, bells, clocks, and other significant elements.
Pay special attention to castles, such as the three most noble ones in Germany: [Vienna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liechtenstein_Castle_(Maria_Enzersdorf)), [Strasbourg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%C3%A2teau_du_Haut-Koenigsbourg), and [Landsberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landsberg_Castle_(Palatinate))[^castles]. Additionally, examine the coats of arms, origins, aqueducts, wonders, and historical sieges of each city.

### Reading Speculative Books

When reading an assertion, consider the following: the main message, the number of points made, the specific words used and their order, what can be inferred, and how the assertion is proven.

To internalize the assertion, break down the arguments into a logical structure and anticipate potential responses.

Are the premises sufficiently strong or well-supported?
How can the supporting arguments be confirmed and what examples can be provided?
With what main idea or argument does it agree or seem to conflict?
What objections could be raised against it?
How would the objections explain the core of the text, each paragraph, and the references?
What does the opposing view assert?
On how many points does it disagree with?
How does it prove each point, and from what principle? What are the objections, their form, and the response to each part?

Use this method of analysis to identify weaknesses in the argument. Consider potential counterarguments from adversaries and how they might respond to your own arguments.
Consider the very objections the author rises and how they could be otherwise resolved and advanced.
How could some difficulty be more clearly posed and in what words, and what does it consist of?

Avoid immediately applying the conclusion to specific cases, such as how physicists apply physical causes to phenomena like fire, trees, or angels, or how theologians apply general principles about sacraments to individual sacraments.

Do not be satisfied with reading the text once; revisit and reread the same material multiple times.
Often, what your intellect couldn't grasp despite much effort will occur to you spontaneously later.

If someone explains the text to you, first reread it yourself to develop the ability to argue through each key point and to argue both for and against each assertion.

Finally, consider how this line of reasoning could be useful in discussions with physicians or scholars.

## IV. Summary

Keep these five things in mind:

1. **Simulate.**
2. **Dissimulate.**  
3. **Trust No One.**
4. **Praise All.**
5. **Mind Your Words**

#### Simulate, Dissimulate

Show yourself as a friend to all and converse even with those you dislike, so that you may learn from their behavior and be cautious in your dealings with them.

Control your anger in all situations, as it can damage your reputation more than many virtues will enhance it.

Always strive to choose the easier path when faced with a difficult decision, as it often aligns with the majority and brings fewer disadvantages.

Always be cautious about sharing your thoughts, knowledge, desires, concerns, and aversions. Ensure that no one knows your true feelings on any matter.

Do not conceal your virtues excessively, and avoid criticizing lengthy sacred rites, as doing so may make you appear irreverent.

Even if you can achieve your goals through more aggressive or forceful means, refrain from using such methods.

#### Trust no One

When someone praises you, be convinced that they mock you.

Refrain from divulging secrets to others, as they may use them to tarnish your reputation.

Avoid self-praise or self-deprecation, as others may use your words against you.

Be restrained in your behavior and actions, as they will be the basis for how others judge you.

If someone criticizes or upsets you, use it as a chance to showcase your integrity and moral strength.

Be cautious of those who appear friendly, they are insincere.

#### Praise All

Always speak positively, or not badly, about others. If someone hears your praise, they will likely inform the person you spoke well of.

Always speak well of your superiors, for it serves the peace.

Also, praise those whose favor you need.

Similarly, express appreciation for the food and clothing you receive from others.

#### Mind Your Words

Consider your words carefully. Could they be interpreted negatively? If so, they certainly will be interpreted that way. Someone you do not see may be watching or listening.
