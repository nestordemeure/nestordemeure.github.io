Much is revealed in illness, drunkenness, during drinking, joking, when dealing with profit or loss, in games and on journeys, where, with the mind's duties relaxed, hidden things more easily come forth. In affliction, especially in offensive situations, etc. These opportunities should be observed, and action should be taken with those whom you wish to know.

It is greatly beneficial to associate with their friends, children, youths, acquaintances, and servants, who can easily be corrupted with small gifts, and reveal much.

When you suspect someone of thinking something, introduce the opposite into the conversation, praising it: if they are thinking the opposite, they will hardly be so cautious as not to betray themselves, either by defending or by adding something, to show that they feel the contrary.

By which vices someone is afflicted, you will know through this art. Introduce into the conversation the vices that are most common and those your friend might be most likely to suffer from; the one they struggle with, they will vehemently attack and condemn. Thus, preachers often struggle with the very vices they fervently accuse.

Ask for advice on some matter, and after several days, deal with the same person again, for by God's providence, we easily forget lies.

Pretend to have knowledge of some matter, and in the presence of the one you think knows it, recount it; by correcting you, they will reveal their knowledge.

Observe with whom someone associates, for they are known by their company, etc.

Praise someone, or comfort them in affliction, for in such cases, hidden and secret thoughts come to light.

Entice someone to tell their life story (which can be done if you pretend to tell yours) and the wrongs they have done to others; from this, you will have a basis for arguing about the present; but be careful not to expose yourself.

You can explore knowledge in this way, for example, give someone an epigram to read; if they praise it excessively and it is of low quality, they are a mediocre poet; if they praise it to the extent it is praiseworthy, they are a poet. Similarly, introduce conversation about food to recognize a glutton; the same applies to other vices and virtues.

It is helpful to propose, in a gathering, that each person offers a judgment in the form of a joke about what someone is worth, what virtues they have, and who is equal in duty? Often, jokes have drawn much truth.

You may also occasionally play the role of a doctor, mixing things into food that make people cheerful and talkative, etc.

A sign of a malicious person is one who frequently contradicts; such people often descend into quarrels.

Those who boast a lot about themselves are not to be feared much. For a timid dog barks more fiercely than it bites.

Fantasizers are those who are scrupulous, sad, talkative, vocal, have very short nails, and perform external mortifications without internal ones.

You will recognize a vain and raised-from-poverty person if they begin to complain about food and clothing; for such elevated beggars aspire to these things in front of nobles.

Secrets are hardly kept by those devoted to wine and Venus, for they are slaves to love; the inconsiderate ones blurt out what they would have kept silent when sober.

You will hold the false and boastful person in this way:
while one of them lists their journeys, pilgrimages,
military service, and deeds, having spent so many
years in that place. Then, calculate the sum
of all, and on another occasion, ask in which year these things began,
when they ended, and how many years of life they have; a great inconsistency
will be revealed. Also, ask how many towers
that city has, or the most famous fortress, invent a name, and whether
they know it, question them: or, as if you are aware of everything,
congratulate them for escaping this or that danger.

You will recognize an honest man and his piety
if harmony is observed in his life, if ambition and the pursuit of a more
distinguished position are absent; if there is no feigned modesty
and composure in all things; no effeminate speech, and no excessive outward
mortification displayed, drinking and eating too little, etc.

By nature, melancholic or phlegmatic people boast that they are mostly distant from ambition and arrogance, and when hurt, they act friendly.

Astute people often have an affected gentleness, a small bump on their nose, and sharp eyes.

Ask someone for advice on something, and their prudence, dexterity, etc., will be revealed. From this, a doubtful and ambiguous mind can also be feigned.

One who easily promises, place little trust in them, because they are deceitful and treacherous.

Consider someone a keeper of secrets if they don't disclose secrets from others to you through any friendship. Therefore, arrange for someone who trusts them or who requests something entrusted to you from them. But they are more likely to reveal secrets to women, beloved children, and those whom one loves more and has higher regard for; if they reveal someone else's secret to you, commit nothing to them, because they might have someone they love as much as you.

It will sometimes be helpful to intercept, read, and respond to the letters of your subjects.

Those who have too many personal and fancy belongings are effeminate and usually not very holy.

Those who have too many beautiful weapons are usually not very good soldiers; overly elaborate tools of the trade indicate they are not very skilled artisans, unless their youth is an excuse. Also, those who indulge in their own nature too much and are very attractive and lovable are not very learned.

You will detect a flatterer in this way: Pretend you did something clearly absurd and boastfully report it. If they praise it, they are a flatterer; otherwise, if they remain silent at least.

You will notice a false friend: Let a third person, instructed by you, inform them that you have been reduced to the extreme, the rights you relied on have been proven false. If they seem not to care, they will never be a friend. Also, send someone to ask for advice and help in your name; you will see what kind of person they become, and once their virtue is tested, pretend everything was falsely reported to you.

Uneducated people reveal themselves with excessive brilliance in their affairs, the decoration of walls, the care of their bed, or if something less Latin is uttered, they laugh and show that they notice.

Beware of short-statured people, for they are stubborn, arrogant, etc.

You can test the harmony of friends in this way: criticize or praise one of them by name in front of another; then, from silence or a cold response, you will discover the whole matter.

Propose some cases in a gathering, as to how one could proceed ingeniously in this or that case. From the response of each, their intelligence and cunning will be revealed. Also, propose how some people can be deceived, introduce a conversation about persecutions; one who claims to have suffered many things will prove to have said the most.

By nature, liars usually have dimples in their cheeks when they laugh.

Be cautious of those who care too much for their skin; there is little to fear from them. Much can be learned from young and very old people in any situation.

A pretender is one who speaks both well and ill of the same thing, and an opportunity must be given for them to do so.

Frequently, those who know many languages have little judgment, because having too much memory can often harm judgment.

If someone suddenly displays great virtues, who was previously vicious, be suspicious.

Whom you think may betray your words, speak some unique and specific things in front of them, things that you have not said in front of anyone else; if the words are revealed, you have found the informer.

If others tell you their dreams, ask for different ones more often, and by engaging in conversation, you will learn much about their hidden thoughts. For example, if someone claims to love you, inquire about their dreams at another time; if they never dream about you, their love is false.

Investigate someone's feelings towards you by displaying interest, or pretending to be their enemy.

Do not show that you are aware of anyone's practice of vice, nor recount others' vices with disapproval or excessive zeal, as you will be judged to suffer from the same faults.

If an accuser comes to you to denounce another, pretend you have already heard it and more; then see what suspicions and details they add that they would not have otherwise mentioned.

Those who are overly affectionate with dogs and delightful children are soft.

Those who speak with an affected voice and affected cough are effeminate, inclined to love; likewise, those who are overly groomed, adorned, desiring to please the eyes of others, and pay too much attention to younger or female ages.

Counterfeiters are those who announce everything too easily, who approve of all your actions too much because this friendship is feigned. Be wary of someone who vehemently attacks others in front of you, as they will do the same to you.

Catch a keeper of secrets like this: Tell them something in utmost secrecy, and tell the same thing to another person with the same caution. Send a third person, who is aware of the deception, to call these two together and mention the secret entrusted to them. Consider the one who indicates being aware of the matter as a betrayer; but if the other does not even show that they are aware of the secret, make them your secretary.

To understand someone's mind, use an intermediary, someone they love, and through that person, you will learn their most hidden thoughts.
