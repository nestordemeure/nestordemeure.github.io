There were once two fundamental principles in Philosophy: *Sustain and Abstain*.
Now, new principles have emerged: *Simulate and Dissimulate*, or *Learn About Yourself* and *Learn About Others*, which (if I am not mistaken) complement each other.

We will first address *Learn About Yourself* and *Learn About Others*.
Then, since human *Actions* often occur in no particular order, we will explore the principles of *Simulate and Dissimulate* in various contexts, without following a strict order.
