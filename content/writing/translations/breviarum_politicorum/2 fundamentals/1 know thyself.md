Do you suffer from anger, fear, recklessness, or any vicious passions?

What flaws in manners, at the table, in the temple, in socializing, playing, and other actions, especially social ones, do people notice in you?

Examine all the parts of your body: are your eyes too bold, your foot or head more bent than necessary, are there wrinkles on your forehead, are the corners of your lips clean, is your walk too slow or too fast?

With whom do you associate, are they praiseworthy, fortunate, and prudent people?

At what times are you most careless, do you fall in word or behavior? Is it at the table while drinking? In games or in times of calamity? Where, according to Tacitus: The souls of mortals are weak.

What places do you frequent, are they suspicious, cheap, infamous, or beneath your dignity?

Be cautious with your actions, and don't lack caution, to which the reading of this booklet serves, in what place, time, in what dignity, and with a person of what dignity do you act?

Note down each flaw, so that your mind pays more strict attention to them.

It will help if you impose a harder task on yourself whenever a slip occurs.

If someone has hurt you, say nothing and do not reveal your anger with any sign, as long as the circumstances are such that you would show your zeal in vain and cannot satisfy yourself; instead, pretend not to be hurt and wait for a more opportune time.

Show nothing on your face but humanity, or even an expression of goodwill. Do not laugh easily at any wit.

Strive to have everyone well understood by you; never reveal your secrets to anyone; investigate others.

Do not speak or do anything indecent in front of anyone, even if it is natural and not malicious, because others despise such people.

Maintain modesty with a steady pace, otherwise, observe everything with sharp eyes and put an end to curiosity with a prudent brow. Such people are considered prudent, cunning, and meticulous.
