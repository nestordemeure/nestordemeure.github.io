Stage a quarrel with a friend to trick your enemy into believing you are genuinely at odds with each other. This may prompt your enemy to reveal their true feelings as they attempt to exploit the situation. Then, suddenly resist and oppose the enemy with your friend's combined strength.

This tactic can also be used against robbers planning an ambush on the road or in similar situations. Intentionally make yourself appear vulnerable and approach the ambush site. When the trap is sprung, flee and lure your attackers into a counter-ambush.

If the person setting the ambush is powerful, choose your words diplomatically to avoid provoking them into taking open action against you. Seek a middle ground in your responses to avoid falling into the powerful person's traps while not revealing that you noticed the deceit.

If others are urging you to take an action that may be harmful to you, feign enthusiasm and make preparations to comply, as long as the preparations are not too complicated or demanding. Meanwhile, secretly plan to do the opposite of what they suggest.
