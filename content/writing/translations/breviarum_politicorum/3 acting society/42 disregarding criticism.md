People are most deceitful when it comes to giving praise or mockery, flattery or taunts.

Collect written satires or mocking texts about you and read them yourself. Also, have others read them and laugh at them, as this will cause the author to despair.

Do not reveal a satirical piece written against you. If it must be revealed, invent a reason for doing so.
However, if the satirical piece must be displayed, take the following steps: read it often at home, learn to laugh at it, and assume appropriate emotions. Imagine that you are mocking it, pretend to have objections, and premeditate fitting responses with an assumed emotion.

If something adverse happens, it should not always be concealed. Otherwise, the very act of concealment may lead others to believe that the adverse event truly occurred.
