Arrange a signal with your servant beforehand. When they receive the signal, have them call you away as if for urgent business. They can whisper in your ear, send a messenger with letters, or announce that harm has been done or that there are disturbances among your subjects.

Have a doctor forbid you from speaking or drinking, etc.

Have a saddled horse brought, as if you are about to depart.

Give oats to your guest's horses, but first shake a wolf skin over them, or provide a stable where a wolf's carcass has been buried.
This will keep them restless.

Provide a bedroom with a specially prepared bed near windows. If it starts raining, open the windows. Block the fireplace so that it smokes, and initially light the furnace.
