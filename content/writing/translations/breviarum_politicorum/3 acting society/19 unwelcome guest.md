Arrange a signal with your servant beforehand. When they receive the signal, have them call you away as if for urgent business. They can whisper in your ear, send a messenger with letters, or announce that harm has been done or that there are disturbances among your subjects.

Have a doctor forbid you from speaking or drinking.

Have a saddled horse brought, as if you were about to depart.

Give oats to your guest's horses, but first shake a wolf skin over them, or provide a stable where a wolf's carcass has been buried.
This will make them restless.

Provide a bedroom with a specially prepared bed near windows that are kept open when it starts raining.
lock the fireplace so that it smokes, and light the furnace before offering the room.
