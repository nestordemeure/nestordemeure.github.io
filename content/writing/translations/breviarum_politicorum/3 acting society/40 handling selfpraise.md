Be cautious not to let praise lead to comparisons or claims of being unique, even if true, as such statements are rarely believed.

If someone openly praises you in the presence of the Prince, doubt whether they have secretly accused you.
When you receive excessive praise, be cautious. If all your actions are praised, you are thanked for everything, and you are favored above others, be highly suspicious of these flatteries, as it may be a trap.

Avoid boasting about all your capabilities, as it will only serve to inform your adversaries.

If you wish to spread your glory through books, such as those containing panegyrics, choose a book that is easily purchased and esteemed worldwide. Ensure that the authors of such works are well-known beforehand and that they include your name and praises. This will spread your fame more effectively than a huge volume that no one will buy or read.
