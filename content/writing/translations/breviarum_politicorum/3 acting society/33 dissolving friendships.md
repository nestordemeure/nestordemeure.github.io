When ending a friendship, never abruptly break it off, as if you suddenly hate the person due to a perceived slight or offense.
Instead, having reconciled and showing fervent love, gradually withdraw. To allow the friendship to gently dissolve, gradually reduce the frequency of your meetings. If you must meet, keep the conversations brief and invite them to dinner, acting as if you are burdened by business. This way, it won't seem like you were only pretending to be their friend until you decided to cast them out.

If he seems to rely on the goodwill of a powerful benefactor, advise him to ask for something so precious that the benefactor would never agree to part with it. When he is inevitably refused, emphasize how such a minor request was denied, exaggerating the incident as if occupied with other matters.

Persuade him to borrow things from a friend that he will likely damage, such as horses for a long journey or clothing for a feast, at a time when the friend will need those items for their own use. Thus, whether harm is done or not, the result will be the same.

Alternatively, suggest that he borrow items from his friend without specifying a time for their return. This way, he will harm himself with the task of reminding the friend or returning the items. Let him be ashamed to meet the other, and so the friendship will gradually cool.

Spread rumors that he relies entirely on his friend's advice and can do nothing independently. Go as far as suggesting that his friend takes care of his house, even his household. Point out his burdens, and so they will meet less often and drift apart.

Alternatively, arrange for a friend to entrust him with a secret, and then secretly spread that information to others. In this way, he will consider his friend's trustworthiness suspect.
