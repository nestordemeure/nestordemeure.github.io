Do not strike with your own hand, lest you be seen as cruel.

If you need to severely punish someone but lack strong justification, consider this approach: First, punish them for a mild offense that you would typically forgive. The offender will resent it and begin to complain and grumble.
When punished again, he will renew his complaints, until as if obstinate, he will give greater cause for a greater punishment, having been found guilty of a serious offense.

Young people can sometimes be further provoked by punishment. Therefore, allow them some controlled outlets that satisfy their desires without encouraging them to seek out additional or similar activities. These outlets should be self-contained and not lead to further temptations.

If you have removed someone from your household, court, or office, and others take it badly, do the following: Spread a rumor and openly express regret, claiming that you finally realized the person was influencing you to the detriment of your subjects, particularly those who lament his downfall. Assure everyone that their affairs will now improve.
To substantiate your claims and build trust, take concrete actions. For example, if you removed a steward, ensure that the wages he was responsible for are immediately paid.

Be generous with justice when it doesn't harm your interests, such as when a regional ruler oppresses their subjects. If the public good demands it, let the favor be remembered, so that the subjects may feel indebted and obliged to bear some burden willingly.

If you wish to correct someone, discuss potential solutions with him. He will find the solutions he comes up with himself most agreeable. Similarly, let him choose his own punishment.

When investigating, do not act confrontational. Deceive when you can without harming yourself and refrain from insulting the well-born.

To carry out a punishment discreetly, give the offender letters to deliver to your agent or letters of recommendation for others. In these letters, secretly include instructions for the offender's punishment.

If you wish to lead someone back to the right path, put him in charge of correcting in others the very vice with which he himself struggles. For example, a drunkard should exact punishment from other drunkards.

If someone humbles himself sufficiently and publicly, spare him, lest by despair you drive him to worse. Nor compel him to that which the guilty party will most refuse. Be content with a moderate vengeance.

After a moderate punishment has been decreed, one should wait to see if perhaps the situation improves.

When you confront the guilty, do not show that you have cut off all avenues for them, so that no one becomes enraged by having their crimes judged without a hearing. Show that you are naturally inclined to be merciful.
