Avoid criticizing someone when they expect praise or are expressing gratitude.

Praise even the smallest deeds, as this encourages diligence.

It is best to admonish someone through a mutual friend, in a confidential manner.

If someone is involved in illicit loves and you wish to help them break free, keep them occupied with challenging tasks and responsibilities.

Discreetly arrange for others to criticize the person's words or deeds. Have them report their findings to you, provide false testimony, and disapprove of all the person's actions.

Pay attention to the people with whom a person associates and sever those connections.
Companions of the same gender should be associated with the person in this matter - men with men, women with women, as the opposite sex has proven harmful.
Assign companions who, if not virtuous themselves, at least have opposing vices. For example, assign one companion who is fierce and another who is gentle, or some who are passionate and others who are calm.
