Carry acid, such as burnt wine, and use it to drench clothes stuffed with straw. Suspend these clothes to create a diversion. The guard will believe you acted out of desperation and, neglecting his watch, will spread word to the others. Seize this opportunity to escape.

Feign illness by eating red ochre to simulate bloody stools, pressing near your elbow to alter your pulse, or inducing pallor. Then request that a doctor be summoned. Complain of being fatigued by insomnia. Request to be transferred to the guard's house and to dine with him that day. Ask for a sleeping draught, which you will introduce in your host's drink.

While preparing for escape, tell your companions you plan to fight your way out with a sword, so that if any of them are questioned by pursuers, they will dash their hopes of catching you easily.

Leave a bloody sword on the road or clothing by a riverbank, as if you had thrown yourself into the waves.
Or persuade your comrades to retreat to safety, and when you are alone, burn down the isolated house you are in, as if you had perished in the flames.

Have a docile horse, double its shoes affixed with nails, and bring durable provisions.

Never inquire about a single escape route, but several at once. When others are around, plan for the escape route you least intend to take. Likewise, when leaving cities and villages, first go into the fields, then change your clothing, cloak, and appearance, and return to a different route than the one you initially took.

If the pursuers are pressing close, leave behind a wounded horse. When it falls into their hands, they will suspect you have been killed. Leave your cap floating in a river or well, so that you may be believed drowned.

Carry a reversible horse blanket with different colors on each side, allowing you to change its appearance as needed. Additionally, bring a mask molded from hide, painted with a different face on each side, so that you can assume them as you please.
