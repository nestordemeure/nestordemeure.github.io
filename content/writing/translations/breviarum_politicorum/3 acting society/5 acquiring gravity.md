Undertake occupations suitable to your role: for example, a Prelate should not handle weapons, a Nobleman should not practice chiromancy, a Religious person should not practice medicine, and a Priest should not teach fencing.

Avoid making promises or concessions.

Laugh sparingly, and when you do, keep it brief.

Do not change what has been decided.

Avoid staring at others.

Do not turn up your nose or furrow your brow.

Do not be sullen.

Make few gestures.

Keep your head erect.

Use few, concise and meaningful, words.

Do not take excessively wide steps. Compose all of your limbs with decorum.

Do not admit to anyone that you love, hate, or fear.

Do not personally handle menial tasks; delegate them to servants and do not discuss them.

Let no one be present when you are eating, going to bed, or getting up.

Keep your circle of friends small and interact with them infrequently, lest you be held in contempt.

Do not engage in conversation indiscriminately in public places.

Avoid abrupt changes in your habits, dress, lifestyle, or appearance, even if these changes are improvements.

When praising or criticizing, avoid excessive exaggeration. Judge proportionately to the matter at hand to prevent your words from losing their impact or credibility.

Rarely display strong emotions, such as excessive joy, admiration, or other feelings.

Demonstrate piety even in the presence of your closest friends.

Even when you are most confident in your position, refrain from complaining about or accusing others.

Do not give your subordinates too many tasks at once or tasks they cannot carry out. Doing so will either lead them to either despise your commands or demonstrate that your orders were ill-advised.

Make no laws, or very few.

Do not be quick to anger, for if you are then quick to be appeased, you will be considered fickle.

If you are going to make a public statement, carefully consider your words beforehand and speak from a prepared text.
