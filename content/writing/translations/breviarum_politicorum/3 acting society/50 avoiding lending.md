When lending items, instruct the servant who is delivering them to provide a detailed receipt. Have the servant sign the receipt as if they were acting on their own behalf, without your knowledge.

If you cannot avoid lending money, consider the following options: claim that you are also in debt or do not have the full amount requested, and ask to borrow something of equal value in return; or explain that you can provide the money without interest if the person offers collateral.

If the borrower has assets that can be divided, suggest that their value will increase by the summer if they deposit a portion of them with you as collateral for the loan.
