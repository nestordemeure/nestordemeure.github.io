If you are writing in a public place, pretend to be copying from another document. Hold up a sheet of paper so others can see it, while keeping your actual writing hidden. Cover your work with a book or another sheet of paper, or position the raised paper so that only the line you appear to be copying is visible to anyone who approaches.

If someone approaches while you are reading, quickly turn to a different page to avoid drawing attention to your focus. It is best to have multiple books combined, allowing you to present one for inspection while concealing the actual book you were reading.

If you are writing letters or reading a book and someone arrives who might find your activity suspicious, anticipate this and pretend to be doing something else entirely. Act as if you are consulting the book or letters in front of you.
For example, if you are writing warnings, ask the approaching guest what you could cautiously and prudently respond to such a case, or ask for news so you could fill the letters. Employ similar tactics when counting money or reading a book.

Do not hesitate to write secrets in your own hand, unless you are employing ciphers that are easily decipherable by others, such as those found in [Trithemius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Trithemius)' [*Polygraphia*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygraphia_(book)). In such cases, having someone else write for you can provide better concealment. Be cautious, as using indecipherable ciphers may raise suspicion and lead to interception, unless you are a skilled writer.
