If you openly display strong emotions or personal feelings for too long, people will eventually oppose your actions.
Therefore, it is better to refrain from publicly displaying these emotions or behaviors.
Encourage others who genuinely feel the same way to do the same.

In the meantime, it is best to focus on serious matters to distract yourself from the emotions you wish to eliminate.

By doing so, you will conceal your true feelings of anger or happiness from even the most attentive observers.
