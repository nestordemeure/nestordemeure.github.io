Consider four things before acting in a novel way:

1. First, consider whether it will be more beneficial or harmful to you?
2. Second, ask yourself if you possess the necessary abilities or talents?
3. Third, consider whether it aligns with your current status?  
4. Fourth, consider whether you are respected in your current role? And in the role you aspire to?
