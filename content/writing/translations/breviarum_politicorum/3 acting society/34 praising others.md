Pretend to be frank, acting as if you speak and act based solely on your own judgment and for the public good, and as if you hate nothing more than flattery.

Excuse someone's gentleness and mercy as a duty of piety, so that their strictness and severity may weaken.

Avoid praising someone in a way that openly criticizes others, except perhaps in a crowd with many confused voices.

Leave people's virtues unpraised and overlook their vices.
