To encourage someone to act, take responsibility for any potential losses, such as goods or property, and offer specific rewards in return.

For example, before a battle, a commander should announce compensation for specific injuries, that he will cover their losses in goods and baggage; meanwhile, he should place a strong garrison in the camp, lest concern for it distract the soldiers' minds.
