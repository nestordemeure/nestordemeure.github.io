Avoid obscene words or actions, as these are the habits of foolish people. Similarly, refrain from mimicking the sounds of birds or other animals.

Never make jokes about things that would embarrass the other person, such as their physical or personality flaws, as these will leave a negative lasting impression.
Furthermore, avoid speaking about the misfortunes of others, whether they are present or not. It is better to listen to such stories than to tell them.

To engage in honest and pleasant conversation, read authors who tell captivating stories and even poets, so that you may learn to express a range of emotions in your interactions.

Never act too freely or commit anything reprehensible in another's presence, no matter how close the relationship.
