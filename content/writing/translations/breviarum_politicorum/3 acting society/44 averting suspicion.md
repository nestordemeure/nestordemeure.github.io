Read the section titled *Gaining Favor*, *Avoiding Offense*, and *Acting Cautiously*.

If you are suspected of having slandered or discredited some accusers before the Prince, write letters praising them to the Prince, and ensure these letters reach *those who suspect you*.

Alternatively, if you wish to vex them, allow genuinely blank letters to be intercepted, making them suspect various secret writing techniques, such as the use of invisible ink that can be revealed by water or heat.

Another option is to write only the *first and last* syllables of each sentence. Then, openly express your hope that these letters do not reach the Prince's hands, so as not to appear as a flatterer.
