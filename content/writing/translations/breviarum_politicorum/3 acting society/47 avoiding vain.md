When dealing with a serious matter, let others focus on trivial aspects like applause and glory.

If an enemy wishes to surrender a city, offer them the most honorable conditions. Make them believe they are doing you a favor rather than being conquered. Let them depart with their banners unfurled and provide them with all the symbolic trappings of victory. In exchange, ensure that they yield the lands, hand over the captives, and leave behind the gold and fortifications before sunset.

This principle also applies to matters valued for their intricacy or diversity, such as artistic or creative works. Let others have these things as a reward, but do not seek them for yourself.

Never warn others of their wrongdoings if it may cause you harm, even if they promise gratitude in return. Words are worth only as much as the air they are made of. They are forgotten at once, while the consequences of your actions always remain with you.

Let others have glory and renown without you; seek power alone for yourself.

If you are promoted to a prominent position, be sure to also promote someone you fear may cause trouble. Let them enjoy the prestige of the office, but not its tangible benefits or power.
