When in the presence of someone whose favor your target seeks or enjoys, praise your target in a way that may turn into an offense to their benefactor.
Emphasize that you are not expressing your own opinion, mentioning that what you said is commonly rumored. Imply to the benefactor that he should be concerned about his own reputation and that the reputation of those close to them is also at risk. Simultaneously, urge the benefactor to disregard rumors and let trivial matters fade away. However, ensure that they still feel the issue at hand concerns them.

Praise the person as if sympathizing with their pains, with a plaintive voice, exaggerating their position and its consequences as if defending it. Say he is outstanding but blemished by a vice, which you are not allowed to mention.

Never threaten one you intend to harm, for he will take precautions. Instead, pretend you are unequal and unable, even if you wished to harm them.

Draw your enemy back into friendship with you and engage them in feasting to lower their guard. Have hidden witnesses present when you speak, so that they may record anything he might inadvertently say against the ruler or others. This will provide material for an accusation.

Exaggerate the deed of an enemy and emphasize the evils that will follow unless he is punished. Meanwhile, to appear less motivated by passion, argue against punishment, but do so ineffectively, and as if saying that hatred must be cast from a distance.

Your enemy's character and deeds must be interpreted, and when the occasion allows, they must be driven into ruin with faltering steps.

Never attack many at once, but form friendships with others in the meantime.

Always secure your own affairs before attacking those of others, and do not indulge in revenge or neglect occasions for conducting your own business.
