When asking a friend for a favor, make sure your request doesn't require too much money or effort. Simply letting them know you need help should suffice. If your friend does not provide the favor voluntarily, he will not do so even if you ask directly.
However, express gratitude for all help provided, as this will subtly convey your desire for further assistance.

If you are about to request something serious, first discuss other matters and subtly explain your desires as if doing something else.

Be cautious when asking nobles for favors, as they may perceive your request as a command.
Seek the help of illustrious people to advocate for you, such as a child asking their parent for a favor, but avoid involving those who have the same need as you.

The best time to ask for a favor is when someone is happy, such as on a feast day or after a meal, but not while they are drowsy, distracted by other business, or struggling to stay awake.

Do not presume to ask for many things at once.

When advocating for someone, treat them as if you don't know them. Limit your interactions with them to demonstrate that your support is based on the merits of their cause rather than personal benefit.

When persuading others, tailor your arguments to their interests and values: emphasize potential gains or losses for those motivated by wealth, appeal to religious beliefs for the devout, offer praise to the young and ambitious, and highlight social pressure for those concerned with their reputation.

Avoid asking a leader for special favors or legal permissions, as these requests are often granted slowly. Instead, wait for the right moment and present the necessary paperwork for their signature.

Do not ask someone for a rare item they cherish, especially if you have no genuine use for it.
If he refuses, he will feel guilty for disappointing you and start hating you, as people often resent those they have wronged.
If he agrees, he may view you as an imprudent requester and avoid you in the future.

To avoid the shame of rejection, only make requests when you are confident they will be granted. Therefore, it is better to explain your need without directly asking for anything.

Conceal your strong desire for something until you have obtained it. To do this, either feign indifference or imply that it has already been promised to someone else, and congratulate them.

If something is denied to you, secretly send another to request it for himself, from whom you will more easily obtain the thing.

If someone wants to snatch from you an honor that you seek, send someone to him who will dissuade him in the name of friendship and show the difficulties.
