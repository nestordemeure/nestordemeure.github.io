First, examine a person's motives and assess whether they are consistent with their claimed actions, typical behavior, or the actions they are suspected of committing.
Additionally, note if the person is acting more passionately or more cautiously than they typically do.

If a person is not acting in their own interest, or if they abruptly change their stance with great zeal, it may indicate that they have been bribed.

If a person does not agree after their stated reasons have been thoroughly disproven, they are not genuinely motivated by those reasons.

Likewise, if someone offers excessively complex, subtle, implausible, unnatural, or trivial arguments while passionately advocating for a cause, it indicates that they are not acting in their own interest.

If an individual advocates for the same position on multiple occasions but offers different justifications each time, disregarding their previous reasons, it is likely because people often struggle to remember arguments that do not stem from their own ideas.

Send someone to approach the person confidently in the name of friendship and to frankly inquire about the cause. This will uncover the person's true motivations.
