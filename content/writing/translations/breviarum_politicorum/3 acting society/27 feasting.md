When hosting a feast, focus on items that can be preserved, such as candied fruits, decorative wax figurines, ornate fountains, artificial mountains, and self-playing musical instruments.

Include artistic elements that are fitting for the occasion, such as wax candelabra covers bearing the coats of arms of your guests, colorful drinks, scented beverages that seem imported from afar, and artificial wines like those described by [Arnaldus de Villa Nova](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnaldus_de_Villa_Nova).

Present flowers, colored lettuces, giant eggs made from several smaller eggs and seasoned with spices, candles burning from ice, fragrant fires, vomiting mountains, fountains sprinkling snow, and fake fragrant fruits or apples brought to the table on their branch - all things which can grow in your garden at little expense.

Mix fruits in bottles and clusters. Even simple vegetables should be presented as if they were exotic, imbued with vibrant colors and flavors.

Prepare meats in various and rare ways, of which [Apicius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apicius) offers very many. Remember, at the table, it is not what is praiseworthy, but what is rare that is esteemed.

Likewise, mix live crabs with cooked ones, counterfeit meats with bones made from flour, fish made from meats pressed in wooden molds, syrups poured in place of broth, and have a wheel made of ice that falls apart on its own.

Some things should appear, spontaneously change color, disappear, and then reappear.

Serve cheeses in various forms and seasonings.

Even the vessels in which dishes are carried can be made from unusual materials, such as imitation gems.
