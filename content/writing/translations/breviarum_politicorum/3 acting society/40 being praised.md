Be cautious not to let praise lead to comparisons or claims of being unique, even if true, as such statements are rarely believed.

If someone openly praises you in the presence of the Prince, ponder whether they have secretly accused you.
When you receive excessive praise, be cautious. If all your actions are praised, you are thanked for everything, and you are favored above others, be highly suspicious of these flatteries, as it may be a trap.

Avoid boasting about all your capabilities, as it will only serve to inform your adversaries.

If you wish to spread your glory through books, such as those that contain panegyrics, do so with a booklet that is easily purchased and can be esteemed in various parts of the world.
Ensure that the authors of such works are well-known beforehand, and that they include your name and praises; for these will spread your fame more than a large volume that no one will buy or read.
