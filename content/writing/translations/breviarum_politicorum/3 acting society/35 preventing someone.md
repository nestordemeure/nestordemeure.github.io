If the person objects or makes an excuse, assure them that you will respect their wishes if it becomes evident that assigning them this duty was not in their best interest.

After you have departed, leave behind letters announcing the person's new position. Instruct that these letters be read on a specific date. If the person writes letters back to you, do not respond to them.

If they complain, reassure them by saying that they will hold the office for only a short time and will be relieved of their duties soon if it seems appropriate.

Exaggerate the person's efforts to help them demonstrate their merits and protect them from the jealousy of others.

Finally, declare that this office is given only to those destined for greater roles, and whose virtue is beyond reproach.
