Delegate minor tasks to others.

Establish a strict schedule for yourself and adhere to it without deviation.
Allocate the smallest amount of time to the smallest tasks, and spend only the time needed to complete each task effectively.

When fatigued by work, avoid undertaking anything further. Instead, refresh yourself with honest play and physical activity. Afterward, you will accomplish more, with greater ease and in a shorter time.
If you must work, take on a task that you can handle without effort.

Divide tasks that span several days into smaller, manageable portions to complete them more efficiently.

Avoid engaging in time-consuming, useless tasks that offer little benefit or recognition, regardless of who requests them.

Refrain from personally dealing with craftsmen, household affairs, gardens, and construction projects, as these tasks are labor-intensive and give rise to one concern after another.
