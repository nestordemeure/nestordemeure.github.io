Never reveal how much money you have to anyone. If strangers ask about your wealth, always claim to have very little.

Deceive potential thieves as much as you can, and tell no one which direction you are heading. To further conceal your route, ask different people for directions and get varying answers.

Beware of joining quarrelers, as they often start fights to distract and rob those who get involved. If someone taunts you, hide your true feelings and remain calm.

Be cautious about trusting those who are dressed splendidly, as if they are of noble blood. Unless you have other information about them, they may be thieves in disguise.

Before getting into bed or eating, carefully examine your surroundings with a light.

Do not employ the servants of the host to attend to you, as they may use this opportunity to spy on your belongings.

Always carry a book with you to pass the time.

Travel with trustworthy companions, and let them lead the way rather than follow behind you.

In slippery and mountainous places, it is useful to employ iron tools and walk on the tips of the feet.

Be brief in your speech, as saying too much may jeopardize your wealth or your life.

Oxen proceed more safely than horses through mountains.
