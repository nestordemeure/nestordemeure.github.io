If you stumble in speech or act thoughtlessly, pretend it was deliberate, to test the judgment of others, or that you misspoke while trying to express something else. Smile as if you achieved your intended goal, or grieve as if you did not.

If you have made a mistake due to ignorance, do not ask others about it in a way that reveals your lack of knowledge or error. Plan ahead on how you would seek the truth or ask for others' opinions on what they would do in a similar situation. Be sure to conceal your own opinion to avoid being perceived as ignorant.

If you have forgotten something you said (which also happens to those not pretending), be careful not to accidentally contradict yourself. It is helpful to have noted the main points you stated.

Be most cautious when attempting to confuse others, as you may accidentally reveal either your ignorance or true intention. Therefore, plan for both potential outcomes beforehand.
