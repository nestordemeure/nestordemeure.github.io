If you have been reluctant or less generous in granting someone's request, be careful not to be overly generous to others in a similar situation for some time afterward, even if it seems minor.
Otherwise, you will either arouse distrust towards yourself or incite hatred between the parties involved.

Never increase severity toward those you govern unless you also increase rewards or benefits at the same time; otherwise, you will either incur hatred or contempt. If you increase both severity and rewards, you will mix love with fear.

If you introduce something new that offends others or your superior, present it as a common occurrence, the widespread nature of the fault will lessen the animosity towards you.

If you are believed to be the source of an unpopular policy, openly perform good deeds among the people, such as reducing taxes or punishments, especially for those well-liked by the public.

If you are planning something unusual, first meet secretly with a theologian or another influential figure and win this person over to your side, so that they may publicly advise, promote, and even compel you to follow through with your plan.

When you are about to impose new laws, demonstrate their necessity and deliberate with the prudent about establishing them. Alternatively, let there be a rumor that you sought their counsel, making you appear more prudent.
You can then, ignoring their advice, impose other laws by your own judgment.

Do not procure a wife, maidservant, or other personal roles for anyone, or persuade them to a certain state of life.

Beware of acting as the executor of a will.

If you are in someone's retinue while he is organizing and commanding his household, be present indeed, but do not suggest or assist with the methods.

When someone comes to a new place, they may too freely praise the old ways and people. Be cautious not to fall into this common mistake.

Even if you personally disagree, follow the more lenient opinion in matters of conscience or other areas, while publicly advocating for the more stringent position.

In the presence of no one should you show that you have power over superiors or have obtained a favor.

Similarly, you should never reveal your opinion about another in any confidence.

Always please a superior by generating profit or benefits, regardless of your position.

It is better to be somewhat, or at least apparently, lax with subjects rather than strict.

If you hear that a presumed friend has spoken ill of you, do not reproach them. You will make an enemy of someone who, until now, was indifferent.

Do not wish to know all the secrets of the great. If it happens to be divulged from elsewhere, suspicion will oppress you.

If someone does something pleasing to you, such as congratulating or greeting you, show that it is most pleasing to you. Otherwise, you might not receive such gestures in the future.

If someone does not keep their word or deed as promised, do not reproach them. You will gain nothing but hatred.

As much as you can, allow yourself to be defeated by your lord in those games in which the contest is about glory, not about any loss to you. You are strong if you conquer others, even if you are conquered by your lord alone.

In whatever familiarity you may have with your lord, never forget reverence and submission. Otherwise, he will think that familiarity breeds contempt.

Do not boast that you have won someone over to your side by your counsel, even if he was willing. He will resist more in the future.

Do not insult the bad outcome of one who did not obey your counsel. Rather, excuse the person who carried out the action.

To one boasting of his wealth, strength, dexterity in leaping, counsel, aidâ€”do not act in a way that suggests you are not enjoying it. If you know his ignorance, feign ignorance yourself.

If you have been gravely injured by a superior, not only do not complain, but do not even let him notice that you were injured, because they hate the one they have injured.

Praise even the smallest gifts as the greatest, if they come from your lord. Proclaim and show that you love then supremely.

Refuse dignities with your whole heart, and do not let many things be conferred on you that shine greatly but bring little utility.
