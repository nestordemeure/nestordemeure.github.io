To reprimand someone without them realizing it, begin by discussing unrelated topics. Then, subtly exaggerate and criticize the actions you want to address.
To obscure the fact that you are reprimanding them, add other details to the conversation. Additionally, frequently encourage them to be positive and cheerful, and include some jokes to lighten the mood.
If they become sad, inquire about the reason. After discussing their emotional state, add all the other points you want to make at the end, even discussing potential solutions in a general sense.

If someone is aware that you suspect them of a certain vice, assign them to handle confidential matters, but without putting anything important at risk. To dispel your suspicion, they will execute the task with great dedication. Hence, it can sometimes be beneficial to appear suspicious.

Scolding stubborn young people who engage in forbidden actions will only encourage them further. Instead, wait for their remorse or for them to grow tired of their behavior.

If it happens that you must change tactics, do not abruptly shift from harsh to gentle.

When dealing with emotionally distant people, be direct and instill fear. However, when dealing with passionate people, proceed cautiously and gently.
