When sympathizing with someone's suffering, console them using common expressions of support, without touching on anything that may offend them.

If someone is disparaged in your presence, be most cautious - neither praise nor condemn them. Both are odious.

Always speak well of your superiors, even if they have offended you. When someone else speaks ill of your superiors, do not agree or pretend to agree with them, even if it pleases you to do so.

You will detect the truth of those who accuse someone before you in this way: Listen to the accusers orally and note down the points, then order them to give these to you in writing. Say you are doing this so that the accusations can be directly presented to the accused person. Compare and you will know the truth.
