OVERCOMING AND REMOVING EVILDOERS.

If someone is to be removed from office, first do not provide them with necessary funds for a while, so that they contract such debts as will suffice as punishment when they are removed from office without having enough to pay their creditors. In this way, you punish them without causing inconvenience and using money.

If someone enjoys the favor of the Lord, take from them a sum of money or something that the Lord carefully guards, or something that greatly concerns their spouse. Take it from them at night and arrange a meeting through a joke, and at the same time warn the Lord to be on guard for treachery and the corruption of their servant, which must all be premeditated.

If it is feared that the injured party may incite unrest and you want to strip the commander of the army of his position, first arrange for his sudden arrest and replace him with someone else in secret so that it is not apparent. Then, transfer their troops to your side and provide them with payment from your own resources so that they do not miss the commander.

If someone is excessively argumentative at the table, for example, disputing and presenting falsehoods, order a piece of paper to be brought so that they may write their opinion, subscribe to it, and then argue about it the next day. If you notice someone ostentatious seeking your office but is unequal to the task, like if you are a war leader - because this is where rivalry mostly occurs - provoke the enemy and make everything difficult, but still ensure the best supply route to the castle for yourself. Pretend to be distracted by another war so that they may take your place, and do not provide them with information about the war, the locations, or the enemy, so that they may fall into difficulties and not rush to help until they know both themselves and you.

If it is expedient to overthrow some young people very gently, so that they may treat their talents effeminately in life, they will be broken by singing, painting, and sculpting. Let the prefect have servants who care nothing for honesty and are willing to sell themselves to every desire, following the young people rather than ruling them. The same applies to others, with such servants fleeing the desperate so that they may strike the languid and the lazy hunter, send hunters, and through an unknown person receive responsive letters from their friend. Let these be lost as if carried by the lazy, so that they may be read by many, ensuring that their affairs do not succeed. At the same time, impose on them many tasks so that they achieve nothing, and advise them to seek and ask for many things. Destroy their beloved animals through cunning, for example, serving them peppered and saffroned food, so that they become rabid. Administer drugs to the horse they intend to use so that it becomes furious when mounted. Offer them great rewards, such as entering a lion's den, and you will see them fall into evident danger.
