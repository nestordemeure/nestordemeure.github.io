JOKING.

Do not introduce obscene words or actions (for this is the behavior of scurrilous people), nor imitate the sounds of birds or animals.

Never make true jokes that would make another person blush due to a defect in nature or morals, for they leave a sharp memory.

Do not recount others' misfortunes, whether they are present or absent, as these stories are for listening, not telling. For honest and pleasant conversation, read authors who narrate events filled with action, even poets, so you may learn to mix emotions. Do not make descriptions of well-known others, never act too freely, nor commit anything reprehensible.
