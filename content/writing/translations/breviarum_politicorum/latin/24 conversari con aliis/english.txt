CONVERSING WITH OTHERS.

There are some from whom conversation is not initially pleasing, but gradually becomes sweeter, and wisdom does not immediately appear as if from the entrance. Others are immediately wise and learned but bring a longer delay and disgracefully fail either in judgment or consequence. Thus, adjust your meetings accordingly. If you are from the former, be rare in conversation, but longer; if from the latter, be frequent but shorter, so you may be agreeable.
Know when to be silent. To know without hating, to bear without indignation is the safest way to converse with people.

Be an infrequent guest, lest you become cheap; choose conversation topics based on what you know affects the person, with some about imagination, with others about arms, speak about poetry, etc., praising them.

Do not act while distracted by other affairs, because then you will pay less attention.

With melancholic people, be serious; with choleric people, be prompt; and be patient if you are inferior.

Do not affect gravity; with a learned or experienced person, use few words and do not pile up many arguments. Use different methods of action towards the uneducated.

Pay attention to the time and whether it is inappropriate; those who prevail by faction or favor, strive to make them your friends in any way, and be intent upon every opportunity, premeditating, e.g., if someone were to criticize you in a meeting; think about how you would calmly bear the sting, respond with gentle words, and certainly persuade yourself that you will appear outwardly as you have shaped yourself inwardly.

If you must speak about a third party, let their name be silent, indeed the place, time, and all circumstances, lest a passer-by hearing it may conjecture about whom the conversation is.

Deal with everyone respectfully, as if they were your superiors.

Show sincerity in those matters that, if exposed, will either not harm you or will win you praise.

Beware of associating with those who make themselves available and easy for every crime, as they will also be against you.

Avoid the furious and desperate, because dealing with them is full of danger.

With princes, always use fewer words; they prefer to be heard rather than to listen. Here, act as a philosopher, not an orator, however familiar they may be, be respectful.

Very rarely and only if it pleases, speak to the one who carries the power of life on the edge of their tongue. Flatter sometimes to bind the prince to you. Otherwise, these sacred things do not stand. But make sure flattery has something of truth and is coated with the appearance of freedom, so you may be believed to speak from the heart.

Give the elderly priority, heed their advice, praise, and venerate them, for they promptly accuse.

Praise and venerate the boastful, read the condition among the uneducated. With chatterboxes, who have everything on their lips, be rare.

Diligently praise what someone loves, and criticize what they hate; if you do the opposite, even unknowingly acting, you will offend.

When dealing with individuals, act as if you had that friend alone, and no other friends.
