ENTERTAINING.

Take great care to provide a variety of items that can be preserved, such as sugar confections or wax sculptures, fountains, mountains, and self-playing music; also those items that are rare and demand a high price, display the coats of arms of those you deal with, use candelabras covered in animal skins on the table, drinks of various colors and with different scents and tastes as if imported, and also ingenious wines, such as those described by Arnold of Villanova. Colored lettuce flowers, large eggs made from many parts and seasoned with spices, candles made of ice and burning, scented fires, erupting mountains, fountains spraying snow, and scented artificial fruits, even apples on the very trees, all brought to the table, which can all grow at a low cost in your garden. Even present vegetables as if they were exotic, with unusual colors.

Apples in jars, and clusters of grapes, meats prepared in various ways and rare, as described by Platina and Apicius, since on the table it is not the praiseworthy but the rare that is valued. Also, serve a mix of live and cooked crabs, meat with bones made from flour, fish made of meat pressed into wooden molds, drizzled with syrup in their own small dishes. A wheel made of ice that naturally solidifies. Some items that change color on their own, appear and disappear, variously shaped and seasoned cheeses, even the vessels in which they are served can be made, for example, with imitation gems.
