ACCUSING.

Let it be the last resort to accuse; do not initiate a lawsuit against someone whom you know is more favored by the judge than you are, unless you have first considered your own case.

If you have initiated a lawsuit, or if it has been brought against you, even if your case is most just, act as if it were extremely bad, meet and preempt the judges with gifts; approach the opponent with mediators, and when they agree on a name, carefully premeditate and leisurely consider the points that can be raised and the weight of the matter, but keep everything most secret. Do not, under any circumstances, be persuaded to show your rights or privileges to anyone, as you will give them something to notice and unravel.

Recognize the nature of those whom you accuse, whether they are fierce or ignorant, so that you know how to moderate yourself; if fierce, choose a time when they are passionate, if ignorant, act slowly; also take care that the accused does not learn in any way that they are accused and for what reason, but let the accusation suddenly befall those who even disturb well-prepared people in their own case.

Also, choose those who will promote your cause; it matters little what crimes or appearance the people have, as long as they are dear to the judge, involve them in danger; showing that their case is at stake, so that they may persuade themselves that they cannot acquiesce unless you act in their utmost peril, moreover, let all accusations be conducted not in the manner of a lawsuit or dispute, but of friendship or secret agitation, mixing in more severe charges arising from the very faults of the judges, which, because they are true, are believed even in the accused, and the judge himself, so that he may realize his own reputation, honor, and life are at stake.

In the presence of the judge, show all mercy towards the accused, only bring up their public misdeeds in order to accuse their fate; which, by law, you would otherwise have to charge on a friend's misfortune.
