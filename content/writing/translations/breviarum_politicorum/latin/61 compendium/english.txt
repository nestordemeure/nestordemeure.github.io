COMPENDIUM OF THE WORK.

Keep these five things in mind, namely:

1. SIMULATE.
2. DISSIMULATE.
3. TRUST NO ONE.
4. PRAISE EVERYTHING.
5. BE MINDFUL OF WHAT YOU DO.

SIMULATE, DISSIMULATE. Show yourself a friend to all, and converse with those you dislike, so that you may learn caution. Suppress anger in every possible way. A single scandal will discredit you more than many virtues will commend you. Always choose the easier path so that it is easier to obey and be greater, as it entails more difficulties, and when a difficult action arises between two, choose the easier one. Always take care that no one knows what you think of a matter, what you know, what you want, what you care for, or what you avoid; it is not expedient to hide virtues too much, nor to accuse sacred matters too much, lest you seem not devout. Even if you can obtain something by a harsher method, do not use it.

TRUST NO ONE. When they praise you, persuade yourself that they mock you, do not entrust any secret, as you are often despised, do not praise yourself, nor criticize, others are plotting against you, so they may find fault in you, do not show freedom in your behavior, from which you will be judged, if someone criticizes and harasses you, think that it proves your virtue, they pretend to be friends, but they are not.

PRAISE EVERYTHING. Speak well or not badly about everything, so that a third person does not know and may report it to the source. Always speak well of your superiors, as it serves peace, praise those whose favor you need, also praise the food and clothing you receive from others.

BE MINDFUL OF WHAT YOU DO. What are you talking about? Can this be interpreted in a better light? If it can, it will certainly be interpreted that way. Perhaps someone is watching or listening, whom you do not see.
