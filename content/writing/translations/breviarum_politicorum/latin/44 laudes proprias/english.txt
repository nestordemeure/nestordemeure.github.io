HEARING AND SPEAKING ONE'S OWN PRAISES.

Be mindful not to allow praises to turn into comparisons or to stand alone, and if true, know that rare things rarely find faith.

If someone openly praises you in front of a prince, suspect that they may have secretly accused you. When you are highly praised, be careful not to be led into a trap. When all your deeds are praised or when thanks are given on behalf of everyone, and you are placed above all others, consider everything suspicious.

Do not boastfully disclose everything you can, for in doing so, you will inform your adversary.

If you wish to spread your glory through booklets, such as those containing panegyrics, use a type of booklet that can easily be purchased by everyone and valued in various parts of the world. Therefore, it is necessary to know the authors of such works, who should interweave your name and praises; for these things will spread you more widely than a huge volume that no one would buy or read.
