TO ACHIEVE TRUTH.

In order to obtain a true judgment of your affairs from others, act so that someone else may present your speech as their own, or read your deed yourself, and refer it to a further judgment, with different levels of humanity among friends; therefore, you should be praised for your faith, not your humility, and from the praises you receive, you may be driven to something, which is humanity. Write nothing to them, and sometimes inquire about the matter; when the deed is approved, there is less humanity.

In court, it is better to please by flattery than to offend with truth.

Nothing is rarer in the palaces of kings, nor more dangerous, than simple truth. However, it must enter.
