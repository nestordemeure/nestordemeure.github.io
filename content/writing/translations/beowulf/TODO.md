## Clean-up the existing translation

* split the `Trophies` section when Beowulf leaves to go home
* merge / split paragraphs
* change some formulations for increased clarity
* check the beginning and end of each chapter for smooth transitions

## Work on the style

Work on improving the style to get what I actually want.

## Illustrations

Illustration-wise, I see two ways to go:

* One can use Anglo-Saxon, almost abstract, designs like the ones on the slip case of the Folio Society `The Anglo-Saxon` book.
* Or, in particular inside the book facing each new chapter, one can use illustration of the [lewis chess pieces](https://www.nms.ac.uk/explore-our-collections/stories/scottish-history-and-archaeology/lewis-chess-pieces/) (and [other](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlemagne_chessmen) similar sets).

Either way, woodblock printings would be nice.
