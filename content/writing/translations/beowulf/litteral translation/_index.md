This is the literal translation of the text I first produced, edited, then annotated.

I have brought two main edits to the text: removing all Christian vocabulary (such as mentions of Cain), as I find those jarring and (while important to the context in which the story was put to paper) not necessarily important to the story itself, and tweaked Beowulf's answer to Unferth (son of Ecglaf) in order to give my [interpretation of the accusation of being a brother killer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unfer%C3%B0#Analysis_in_Beowulf):

> I don't boast much of that - though you *let* your brothers's die, your near kin, good as your wit may be. I say to you truly, son of Ecglaf, that Grendel, the fell monster, would never have done such horrors, such grim injuries, to your lord, humiliation in Heorot, if your spirit, your heart, were as battle-fierce as you yourself claim.

The annotations are more highlights, making sure that further pass on the text would keep elements I deem important, than insightful notes (I might revisit them later to turn them into literal highlights).
