> *"The more the poem is read, the less it is read except in translation"*
— John D. Niles, [Rewriting Beowulf: The Task of Translation](https://www.jstor.org/stable/378784)

Beowulf has been [translated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_translations_of_Beowulf) and [adapted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_adaptations_of_Beowulf) many times (you will find a handy comparison of various translations [here](https://www.paddletrips.net/beowulf/html/grendel.html)).
I believe this stems from [the impossibility of producing a perfect translation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translating_Beowulf)—a translation that would both preserve the form ([alliterative verse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliterative_verse)) and produce a text whose meaning is clear to modern readers (is the text even designed to be read silently?). This produces many compromises, as well as axes of freedom, for the translator (see John D. Niles's excellent [Rewriting Beowulf: The Task of Translation](https://www.jstor.org/stable/378784) for a discussion on the topic).

The following is a list of takes on the text that I find of personal interest:

* [*Beowulf: A New Verse Translation* by Seamus Heaney](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/147453272-beowulf)
This has become the de facto classic translation of Beowulf by which all others are weighed ([which does not mean that it is without strong idiosyncrasies](https://people.umass.edu/sharris/in/e505s/ChickeringHeaneywulf.pdf)).

* [*Beowulf: A Translation and Commentary* by J.R.R. Tolkien](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23198296-beowulf)
As someone who does not read Old English, I found Tolkien's commentary particularly insightful as to the various meanings and implications that can be found in the words of the original (and, with them, the compromise inherent to the translation).
I also like his [Sellic Spell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sellic_Spell), an attempt at building *a* Norse folktale that could have evolved into the Beowulf we got.

* [*Beowulf* by Meghan Purvis](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57429810-beowulf)
This is poetry. Splitting Beowulf into different stories and voices, breathing a lot of life and humanity into the text (see also [her essay on translating Beowulf](https://www.pennedinthemargins.co.uk/index.php/2013/06/meghan-purvis-on-translating-beowulf/), as well as her [PhD dissertation on the translation process](https://ueaeprints.uea.ac.uk/id/eprint/43019/1/2012PurvisMPhD.pdf)).

* [*Grendel* by John Gardner](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/676737.Grendel)
This tells the tale from an existentialist Grendel's perspective. One could hardly think of a more modern take on an ancient story.

* [*Beowulf: The Script Book* by Neil Gaiman and Roger Avary](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/291858)
This contains two versions (the original as well as the one actually used for the movie) of the screenplay Neil Gaiman and Roger Avary wrote for the [2007 Beowulf movie](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0442933/).
I particularly like the first version, which manages to be faithful to Beowulf while being entertaining and having its very own (very horny) voice.
One notable element is that they introduced the idea of Beowulf being the father of the dragon, and lying about slaying Grendel's mother, as a powerful dramatic engine to get to the final third of the story.

* [*Bea wolf* by Zach Weinersmith and Boulet](https://www.smbc-comics.com/bea/)
This is very much Beowulf meets [Craig of the Creek](/likes/cartoons/craig%20of%20the%20creek.md). It is not my vision of the text but, still, it is a lot of (alliteration rich!) fun.
