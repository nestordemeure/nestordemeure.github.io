Beowulf has been [translated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_translations_of_Beowulf) and [adapted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_adaptations_of_Beowulf) many times. I believe this stems from the impossibility of producing a perfect translationâ€”a translation that would both preserve the form ([alliterative verse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliterative_verse)) and produce a text whose meaning is clear to modern readers (is the text even designed to be read silently?). This produces many compromises, as well as axes of freedom, for the translator.

The following is a list of takes on the text that I find of interest:

* [*Beowulf: A New Verse Translation* by Seamus Heaney](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/147453272-beowulf) This has become the de facto classic translation of Beowulf by which all others are weighed.

* [*Beowulf: A New Translation* by Maria Dahvana Headley](https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374110031/beowulfanewtranslation) This translation (and in particular [this review](https://www.npr.org/2020/08/27/906423831/bro-this-is-not-the-beowulf-you-think-you-know)) is the text that got me interested in Beowulf. I love the concept, the boldness of the vision, and the belief that one should engage with the text, but I stand by my belief that there are better executions of similar ideas.

* [*Beowulf* by Meghan Purvis](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57429810-beowulf) This is poetry. Splitting Beowulf into different stories and voices, breathing a lot of life and humanity into the text (see also [her essay on translating Beowulf](https://www.pennedinthemargins.co.uk/index.php/2013/06/meghan-purvis-on-translating-beowulf/)).

* [*Grendel* by John Gardner](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/676737.Grendel) This tells the tale from an existentialist Grendel's perspective. One could hardly think of a more modern take on an ancient story.

* [*Beowulf: The Script Book* by Neil Gaiman & Roger Avary](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/291858) Peering into other mediums, this contains two versions (the original as well as the one actually used for the movie) of the screenplay Neil Gaiman wrote for the [2007 Beowulf movie](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0442933/) (which was also turned into a graphic novel).

* [*Beowulf: A Translation and Commentary* by J.R.R. Tolkien](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23198296-beowulf) The gold here is Tolkien's commentary. His essay [Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beowulf:_The_Monsters_and_the_Critics) has been transformative for the text and its interpretations, opening the way for a new wave of thinking on the topic.
