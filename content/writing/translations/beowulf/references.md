> *"The more the poem is read, the less it is read except in translation"*
— John D. Niles, [Rewriting Beowulf: The Task of Translation](https://www.jstor.org/stable/378784)

Beowulf has been [translated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_translations_of_Beowulf) and [adapted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_adaptations_of_Beowulf) many times (you will find a handy comparison of various translations [here](https://www.paddletrips.net/beowulf/html/grendel.html)).
I believe this stems from [the impossibility of producing a perfect translation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translating_Beowulf)—a translation that would both preserve the form ([alliterative verse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliterative_verse)) and produce a text whose meaning is clear to modern readers (is the text even designed to be read silently?). This produces many compromises, as well as axes of freedom, for the translator (see John D. Niles's excellent [Rewriting Beowulf: The Task of Translation](https://www.jstor.org/stable/378784) for a discussion on the topic).

The following is a list of takes on the text that I find of personal interest:

* [*Beowulf: A New Verse Translation* by Seamus Heaney](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/147453272-beowulf)
This has become the de facto classic translation of Beowulf by which all others are weighed ([which does not mean that it is without strong idiosyncrasies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beowulf:_A_New_Verse_Translation#Critical)).

* [*Beowulf: A Translation and Commentary* by J.R.R. Tolkien](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23198296-beowulf)
Tolkien engaged repeatedly with the text. His essay, [Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beowulf:_The_Monsters_and_the_Critics), has been transformative for the text and its interpretations, opening the way for a new wave of thinking on the topic.
This contains not only one of Tolkien's translations of Beowulf, but also the [Sellic Spell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sellic_Spell), his attempt at building *a* Norse folktale that could have evolved into the Beowulf we got.

* [*Beowulf* by Kevin Crossley-Holland](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/915220)
This translation was written to be told to children at night. It is likely the one with the greatest clarity, at the price of a lot of assumptions and decisions on aspects such as character motivations, leaving little up for the reader's interpretation.

* [*Beowulf* by Meghan Purvis](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57429810-beowulf)
This is poetry. Splitting Beowulf into different stories and voices, breathing a lot of life and humanity into the text (see also [her essay on translating Beowulf](https://www.pennedinthemargins.co.uk/index.php/2013/06/meghan-purvis-on-translating-beowulf/), as well as her [PhD dissertation on the translation process](https://ueaeprints.uea.ac.uk/id/eprint/43019/1/2012PurvisMPhD.pdf)).

* [*Grendel* by John Gardner](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/676737.Grendel)
This tells the tale from an existentialist Grendel's perspective. One could hardly think of a more modern take on an ancient story.

* [*Beowulf: The Script Book* by Neil Gaiman & Roger Avary](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/291858)
Peering into other mediums, this contains two versions (the original as well as the one actually used for the movie) of the screenplay Neil Gaiman wrote for the [2007 Beowulf movie](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0442933/) (which was also turned into a graphic novel).

* [*Bea wolf* by Zach Weinersmith and Boulet](https://www.smbc-comics.com/bea/)
Could a comic book about kids playing be a faithful retelling of Beowulf? Yes.
