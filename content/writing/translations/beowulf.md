> *"If you wish to translate, not rewrite Beowulf, your language must be literary and traditional: not because it is now a long while since the poem was made, or because it speaks of things that have since become ancient; but because the diction of Beowulf was poetical, archaic, artificial (if you will), in the day that the poem was made."*
— J. R. R. Tolkien, [Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beowulf:_The_Monsters_and_the_Critics)

## Prelude

### Another Translation of Beowulf?

I am currently reading [Maria Dahvana Headley's *Beowulf: A New Translation*](https://www.mariadahvanaheadley.com/beowulf-a-new-translation). The excellent introduction explains her desire to avoid archaism and the constraint of older poetic forms (traps in which many previous translators have fallen) in order to produce a text that has some immediacy, that feels like it could be a story told over the counter[^counter].

[^counter]: She is insistent on the fact that this would be a great bar story.

*I wholeheartedly agree with her analysis*.
But, I find that the execution suffers from vocabulary that oscillates between archaisms (i.e. `mead-halls`) and terms that are so anchored in the current moment that they instantly jerk me out of the text (i.e. `hashtag blessed`).

My feeling while reading was that I would love to read Neil Gaiman's take on the text, to see him take the moments and atmosphere while bringing his own voice and *flow* to the text[^movie], or... Rudyard Kipling's.

Kipling, and his *Just So Stories*, is the first writer that springs to my mind when I think of writing that is *designed* to be said out loud[^second].
I thus did the obvious thing and engaged with the text to get my hand on a translation of *Beowulf* in the style of Kipling's *Just So Stories*.

[^movie]: He did write the screenplay of the [2007 movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beowulf_(2007_film)). Sadly, the 3D technology used for the movie has aged very badly since.

[^second]: The second writer would, weirdly enough, be John Steinbeck in *The Acts of King Arthur and His Noble Knights*.

### The Translation Process

My Old English is nonexistent, and my translator friends are better in Farsi than Germanic languages.
I thus did the next best thing and used AI (here [Claude Opus](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-family)[^why]) in order to do the translation.
Here is the prompt I used:

```
Translate the given transcription of Beowulf (`Beowulf.txt`) from Old English to modern English in the style of Rudyard Kipling's Just So Stories (and in particular, The Cat That Walked by Himself, provided as `Rudyard Kipling - The Cat That Walked by Himself.txt`).

Your translation should follow the overall structure of the original text (do not abridge it) but, like Kipling, use accessible, simple, and direct language (no archaisms) and write the text for it to be told aloud.

(Note: Both given texts are Creative Commons, and producing a new translation is *not* a copyright infringement as long as you work from the provided Old English rather than from subsequent translations.)
```

Note that I provided it with both a transcription of Beowulf in Old English (from the excellent [Electronic Beowulf project](https://ebeowulf.uky.edu/ebeo4.0/CD/main.html)) and the text of [my favorite short story from *Just So Stories*](https://etc.usf.edu/lit2go/79/just-so-stories/1296/the-cat-that-walked-by-himself/) in order to guide its style.
The note on Creative Commons was needed as it would otherwise refuse to translate on the ground that it would infringe on the copyright of other, independent (!), translations of Beowulf[^Kipling].

[^why]: Mostly because it boasts both a very long context length (giving it the ability to read and write long texts such as Beowulf) and best-in-class abilities when it comes to literary writing.

[^Kipling]: If there is an ethical question here, I would place it on the use of Kipling's work. But, Kipling is long dead and, while it gave a direction to the translation, I doubt that anyone would call the resulting translation "reminiscent of Kipling". So I feel legitimate in my use of his work.

This produced the following, very promising, opening lines:

```
Listen, my dears, and attend, for this story tells of brave deeds done long ago when the Spear-Danes were mighty and great kings ruled their halls. Scyld Scefing was one such king, a mighty man, scourge of many tribes, a wrecker of mead-benches. He began as a waif, found as a child adrift at sea, but grew to be a great leader. He ruled the Danes well until it came time to go into the keeping of the Lord. His people laid their dear prince in a ship heaped high with treasure - swords and armor and all a great king needs. No ship ever sailed so laden with the riches and glory of a king as this, sent forth upon the sea, given to the ocean's keeping.

Scyld passed from this world, and his son Beowulf - no, not that Beowulf, my dears, but another of that name, an elder Beow - took the throne and ruled well and long as the Danes prospered. And when Beowulf in turn passed on, his son Healfdene came to rule. A good king he was too, ruling for many a year, seeing his people thrive. Four children he had - Heorogar, Hrothgar, and Halga the good, and a daughter I hear was queen to the king of the Swedes.

Now Hrothgar was given glory in battle and his men followed him gladly. It came into his mind to build a great mead-hall, mightier than men had ever seen, where he could share out all that God had given him with young and old alike. From far and wide they came to build that mead-hall high and broad and awaiting a name to ring out in the land. When it was ready, Hrothgar gave it the name 'Heorot'...
```

After adding `Write a *full* translation. Here is a beginning to get you started (from a previous conversation with you):` and the opening to my prompt, I obtained the final translation.

### Notes

The translation obtained is serviceable and does follow the text (how much of it comes from the model being able to read Old English and how much of it comes from Beowulf being a classic text whose plot is well known is hard to say).
Where it fails, however, is in my original objective of emulating Kipling's oral style. Fixing it will be for another day.

The chapter splits are roughly based on [Carrigan's model of Beowulf's design](https://www.jstor.org/stable/25505137) and mostly intended to bring rythm to the reading experience.

## Beowulf

### Beginnings

Listen, my dears, and attend, for this story tells of brave deeds done long ago when the Spear-Danes were mighty and great kings ruled their halls. Scyld Scefing was one such king, a mighty man, scourge of many tribes, a wrecker of mead-benches. He began as a waif, found as a child adrift at sea, but grew to be a great leader. He ruled the Danes well until it came time to go into the keeping of the Lord. His people laid their dear prince in a ship heaped high with treasure - swords and armor and all a great king needs. No ship ever sailed so laden with the riches and glory of a king as this, sent forth upon the sea, given to the ocean's keeping.

Scyld passed from this world and his son Beowulf - no, not that Beowulf my dears, but another of that name, an elder Beow - took the throne and ruled well and long as the Danes prospered. And when Beowulf in turn passed on, his son Healfdene came to rule. A good king he was too, ruling for many a year, seeing his people thrive. Four children he had - Heorogar and Hrothgar and Halga the good, and a daughter I hear was queen to the king of the Swedes.

Now Hrothgar was given glory in battle and his men followed him gladly. It came into his mind to build a great mead-hall, mightier than men had ever seen, where he could share out all that God had given him with young and old alike. From far and wide they came to build that mead-hall high and broad and awaiting a name to ring out in the land. When it was ready, Hrothgar gave it the name 'Heorot' and within its walls the king dealt out rings and treasure at the feasting. High rose the roof, tall stood the walls awaiting the hostile flames of hateful fire. But not yet did feuds arise, the evil work of in-laws
sworn in blood.

But a demon bided his time in torment, suffering sorely from the sounds of joy each day in the hall. The music of the harp, the clear song of the poet grated upon this grim spirit. For the God-cursed creature, that wretched being, could not abide their gladness. Grendel was his name, a mighty stalker of the marshes, who haunted the moors and wild fens. This miserable man had long dwelt with monsters since the Creator cast them out as kin of Cain. Upon Cain the Eternal Lord avenged the murder, the slaying of Abel. No joy had Cain in that feud, for the Lord drove him forth, far from mankind for his foul deed. From him descended all evil beings - ogres and elves and the undead - and with them that wretch Grendel, who now waged war on Hrothgar.

### Grendel

In the dark of night Grendel came to survey Heorot. He found within a band of noble warriors at rest after the feasting. No fear assailed them yet. The vile creature, grim and greedy, savage and cruel, was ready at once. Snatching thirty thanes as they slept, he returned to his lair, exulting in his spoil, reddened with slaughter, to seek his den.

At dawn, with daylight, Grendel's deeds were known. After their feasting, weeping arose, a great cry in the morning. The mighty lord, noble prince, sat joyless when he learned of the slaughter of his men. Grief-stricken, Hrothgar, once glad, wept for his thanes.

But Grendel did not long wait to strike again. The next night he wrought more murders, caring nothing for the feud and evil deeds. Men found it easy then to seek out other places to sleep, beds in other buildings when the hate of that hall-thane became known far and wide. Whosoever escaped the fiend kept far from Heorot thereafter.

So Grendel ruled in defiance of right, alone against them all, until that greatest of houses stood empty. Twelve years of sorrow the Lord of the Danes suffered under that scourge. Sad tidings spread, sorrowful tales told afar - how Grendel harried Hrothgar ceaselessly with hate, with war and slaughter. He would not parley for peace with any Dane, nor cease his deadly attacks, nor could the wisest men expect worthy compensation from the slayer's hands.

The vicious demon, a dark shadow of death, pursued both old and young, lurking and lingering in the misty moors. By night he haunted Heorot, that splendid hall, but its throne he could not touch, being shunned by the Lord for his evil ways. Heavy was Hrothgar's heartache, deep his despair. Many mighty men often sat in counsel, seeking advice on what strong-hearted men should do against these terrors. Sometimes they made sacrifices to heathen idols at pagan temples, praying for the slayer of souls to aid them in their people's distress. Such was their practice, their heathenish hope; they thought only of Hell in their hearts, knowing nothing of God, Judge of deeds, the Lord God, nor giving praise to the Protector of Heaven, the Ruler of Glory.

Woe to he who through fierce affliction thrusts his soul into the fiery abyss, who hopes for no solace nor change at all! Well for he who after death seeks the Lord, craves protection in the Father's arms!

So Healfdene's son brooded incessantly over the miseries of the time. The wise hero could not deflect the woe. Too heavy, too hateful and longsome, was the struggle that had come upon that people, a cruel torment, the greatest of evils.

Then from his home Hygelac's thane, great among the Geats, heard of Grendel's doings. He was the mightiest man of valor in his day, noble and powerful. He commanded a ship to be readied, saying he would seek that famous king over the swan's riding, the great prince in his need. Little did his prudent thanes blame him for that quest, though he was dear to them; they spurred on the stouthearted man, and sought omens for his journey.

The valiant one had chosen champions of the Geatish people, the keenest he could find; with fourteen men he sought the ship. Skilled in the sea, he led them to the shore where the ship awaited. In time they sailed, the boat under cliffs, the warriors ready with weapons on the prow, until the wind bore them over the billowing waves to the Scylding's shore. There the curve-prowed ship, all ringed with armor, came aground. The seafarers clambered ashore eager for action, rattling armor and gear. They gave thanks to God for their easy crossing.

From his rampart the Scylding watchman, guardian of the sea-cliffs, saw bright shields and battle-gear being unloaded. His curiosity urged him to know who they were. Hrothgar's thane rode his horse down to the shore, brandishing a mighty spear in his hands as he spoke:

"What warriors are you, armor-clad, who come over the sea-lanes in your steep-hulled ship? I've held this coast-guard post many a year to see that no foes threaten the Danes from sea-raids. Never have shield-bearing men made landfall more openly, nor did you seek permission from us, my folk's agreement! I've never seen a mightier noble on earth than that one among you, a hero in armor. Unless his looks belie him, he is no mere retainer decked out in weapons, but a mighty man indeed. But now, before you go further as spies into Danish land, I must know your lineage and where you hail from. Now, far-dwellers, seafarers, hear my plain thought: it is best to declare promptly from whence you come."

The prince of the company answered him, unlocking his word-hoard:

"We are of the Geatish nation and Hygelac's hearth-companions. My father was well-known to folk, a noble leader named Ecgtheow. He saw many winters before he passed from this world; nearly every wise man well remembers him. With friendly intent we come to seek your lord, Healfdene's son, guardian of his people. Give us your guidance; we have a great errand for the famed lord of the Danes."

Wulfgar, proud prince of the Wendels, whose might and mind were known to many, replied:

"I will make known your request to the king of the Danes, giver of rings, as you ask - our famous prince - about your journey, and swiftly relay the answer that noble one sees fit to give me."

He turned quickly to where Hrothgar sat, old and gray-haired among his company of thanes. The sturdy one strode up, standing shoulder to shoulder with the king of the Danes. He knew the custom of the court.

Wulfgar spoke to his friendly lord: "Here, traveled from afar over the ocean's expanse, people of the Geats have come. The foremost of these warriors is called Beowulf. They ask, my lord, to exchange speech with you. Do not refuse them your answers, gracious Hrothgar! By their battle-gear, they appear worthy of the respect of nobles, and the chief among them, who leads these warriors, is surely a valiant man."

Hrothgar, protector of the Scyldings, spoke:

"I knew him when he was a boy. His father was called Ecgtheow, to whom Hrethel the Geat gave his only daughter in marriage. Now his bold son has come here to seek a loyal friend. Seafarers, too, have said - those who carried gifts of thanks to the Geats - that he has the strength of thirty men in his mighty handgrip. Great-hearted he seems to me! God has sent him to us West-Danes, I expect, as a guard against Grendel's terror. I shall offer the good man treasures for his daring. Make haste now, summon him in, see the band of kinsmen gathered together. Tell them too they are welcome to the Danish folk."

Wulfgar went to the door and delivered the message:

"My victorious lord, the East-Danes' king, commands me to tell you he knows your noble birth and you are welcome to him here over the rolling sea-waves, hardy-minded men. Now you may go in your battle-gear, under your helmets, to see Hrothgar. But let your war-shields wait here, your spears too, the work of the smith, until your talk with the king is done."

The mighty one arose then, surrounded by his sturdy band. Some remained to watch the war-gear as the brave man ordered. The rest hustled in, as the hero guided them under Heorot's roof. The bold chief strode on, hard under helm, until he stood before the hearth, his mail-shirt shining, his armor sewn by the smith's skills.

Beowulf spoke - on him the mail gleamed, an artful web woven by wit of the smith -

"Hail to you, Hrothgar! I am Hygelac's kinsman and thane. Many great deeds I undertook in my youth. Grendel's ravages were made known to me in my native land. Seafarers say this hall stands empty and useless to all once evening falls and the light fades under heaven's vault. So my people urged me, the wisest men, to seek you out, sovereign Hrothgar, for they know my strength. They saw themselves how I returned bloodied from foes where I bound five, destroyed a troll family, and by night slew sea-monsters on the waves, enduring great anguish, avenging the Weders' woes - they asked for trouble! - crushing the angry beasts. And now alone I shall settle the score with Grendel, the giant, the evil sprite. One thing I ask of you, lord of the Bright-Danes, protector of the Scyldings: do not refuse me, defender of warriors, friend of the people, now that I have come from afar, that I may purge Heorot alone with my loyal troop, this sturdy band. I have learned that the monster in his recklessness does not care for weapons. Thus I too scorn - so that Hygelac my liege-lord may be glad - to bear sword or broad shield, the yellow battle-board, into this fight. With my grip alone I shall grapple the fiend and fight for life, foe against foe. He whom death takes must trust in the Lord's judgment.

I expect, if he is allowed his way, he will devour fearlessly the Geatish folk in that war-hall as he has often done with your mighty men. You will have no need then to cover my head, for he will have me bloodied, if death takes me, he will bear off my bloody corpse thinking to taste it, the ruthless slayer will eat without remorse, staining his moor-lair. No longer then need you fret over the disposal of my body! But send to Hygelac, if battle takes me, the matchless mail-shirt that wards my breast, finest of garments. It is Hrethel's heirloom, Weland's work. Wyrd always goes as it must!"

Hrothgar, protector of the Scyldings, replied:

"For fights and favors, Beowulf my friend, you have sought us out. Your father's deeds brought about the greatest of feuds. He was Heatholaf's slayer among the Wylfings, so that war-like people, fearing feud, would not have him. From there he sought out the South-Danes, the Honor-Scyldings across the rolling sea, when first I ruled the Danish folk and held in my youth this wide realm, this treasure-city of heroes. Heorogar was dead then, my elder brother, Healfdene's son had passed away. He was a better man than me! Later I settled that feud with money; I sent old treasures over the sea to the Wylfings. Your father swore oaths to me.

It pains me to tell any man what shame Grendel has wrought in Heorot with his hatred, his sudden attacks. My hall-troop, my warrior band, is thinned by Grendel's terror. Fate has swept them into his horrid grasp. But God may yet stop the mad ravager from his deeds.

Often over ale-cups boasting warriors, emboldened by the beer, have vowed to await Grendel's attack here with their swords. Then in the morning this mead-hall was bloodstained, the benches drenched in gore, the hall spattered with sword-blood when daylight shone. There were fewer tried troops then, dear warriors death had carried off. But take your seat now, share a feast, bold soldier, with these hall-thanes as your heart urges."

A bench was then cleared for the Geatish band together in the beer-hall. There the stout-hearted went to sit, proud in their strength. A thane waited upon them, carrying in his hands the heavy ale-cup. He poured shining mead while a clear-voiced poet sang songs in Heorot. There was joy and laughter, the sounds of a great company of both Danes and Weders.

But Unferth, son of Ecglaf, who sat at Hrothgar's feet, spoke contrary words. Beowulf's quest, the brave seafarer's voyage, was vexing to him for he begrudged any man more glory won in this world than he himself commanded:

"Are you that Beowulf who vied with Breca in swimming on the open sea, where in your pride you tested the water and risked your lives in the deep water for a foolish boast? Neither friend nor foe could dissuade you from that sorry journey when you two swam out into the sea. You stretched your arms over the ocean stream, gliding over the water, wrestling with the waves as winter's swell heaved. You toiled seven nights in the sea's power - he outswam you, his strength was greater. Then in the morning the sea bore him up onto the land of the Heatho-Reams, from whence he sought out his home, dear to his people, his own country, the fair stronghold where he was chief of folk, had a strong fortress and followers. All his boast against you the son of Beanstan truly performed. So I expect worse results yet for you,  
though you have proved yourself in every battle if you dare wait out the night with Grendel near."

Beowulf, son of Ecgtheow, spoke:

"Well, friend Unferth, drunk with beer, you have rambled on about Breca, boasting of his deeds! The truth is I had greater sea-strength, endurance in the waves, than any other man.

He and I made a pact, being boys, and boasted - both still in our youth - that we would venture our lives out in the ocean, and so we did. As we swam the sea we each held a naked sword hard in our hands, thinking to guard ourselves against whales. No way could he float away far from me over the flood-waves, swifter on the sea, nor did I wish to swim from him. So we stayed side by side for five nights at sea, till the flood, the tossing waves, the icy sea and night's darkness drove us apart and a fierce north wind beat down upon us - rough were the waves. The anger of the sea-fish was aroused then.

My body-armor, hard-linked and hand-forged, helped me against those foes. A woven war-shirt covered my chest, decked in gold. A fierce foe dragged me to the depths, held me tight in its grim grip, but it was granted to me to reach the monster with my sword-point, my war-blade. The battle carried off that mighty sea-beast through my hand."

"That is how those loathsome creatures time and again threatened me. I served them well with my precious sword as was their due. Not at all did they have any joy of the feast, those wicked raiders, sit round devouring me at the sea-bottom. But in the morning, wounded by blades, they lay cast up along the surf, put to sleep by swords, so that never after would they hinder seafarers on their voyages over the high seas.

Light came from the east, that bright beacon of God, and the seas grew calm so that I could see the sea-cliffs, those windswept walls. Wyrd often spares an undoomed man when his courage endures! Nevertheless, it was granted to me to slay nine sea-beasts with my sword. I have never heard tell of a fiercer night-fight under heaven's vault, nor of a man more wretched on the waves. Yet I escaped with my life from the enemy's grasp, weary of the struggle. Then the sea bore me up, the flood-tide on the current, to the land of the Finns.

I have not heard any such tales told of you, Unferth, of terrors or of sword-play in the night. Breca never achieved such a deed with his blade - nor you either! - though it was your kin you killed, your close relatives. For that you will suffer damnation in hell, clever though you are. I say to you truly, son of Ecglaf, that Grendel would never have wrought such horrors, that gruesome beast, against your lord, shaming Heorot and working such havoc, if your spirit were as battle-fierce as you claim! But he has found he need not greatly fear feud or assault from your victory-famed clan, the Spear-Danes. He takes his toll, shows no mercy to the Danish people, he maims and slaughters at his pleasure, expecting no fight from the Danes in return. But now a Geat will show him strength and courage in battle! Afterwards he who wishes may go bravely to mead, when morning light, beacon from the east, shines over the children of men on another day and the sun is radiant again!"

The grey-haired giver of treasure was glad at heart. The renowned king of the Danes looked for help; that shepherd of his folk had faith in Beowulf's aid once he had heard his resolve.

There was laughter then from the brave Danes, din resounded, and words were glad. Wealhtheow came forth, Hrothgar's queen, mindful of etiquette. Gold-adorned, she greeted those in the hall and then that noble lady handed the cup first to the East-Danes' homeland-guardian, bidding him be blithe at the beer-drinking, beloved by his people. The victorious king took the feast-cup with pleasure.

Then the lady of the Helmings went about to every part of the hall, bestowing treasure-cups on veteran and youth until the moment came that the ring-graced queen, of noble heart, bore the mead-cup to Beowulf. She greeted the Geats' leader, giving thanks to God with wisest words for fulfilling her desire that in some man she could trust as a deliverer from their troubles.

That stout spearman received the cup from Wealhtheow, then ready for combat he spoke formal words - Beowulf of the Geats:

"I meant, when I put out to sea and boarded our ship with my men, that I would fully work your folk's will or else fall slain in the foe's grasp. I shall achieve a heroic deed or meet my end-day here in this mead-hall!"

Those words, that hero's bravado, pleased the lady well. Gold-decked, the noble folk-queen walked to sit by her lord.

Then once more as before, brave words were spoken in the hall and the people were joyous, the victorious sounds, until Healfdene's son wished to seek his evening rest. He knew that battle was planned for the high hall when they could not see the light of sun and night stepped forth all swathed in shadows, dark under the sky. The whole troop rose.

Man saluted man, Hrothgar bidding Beowulf health and weal, power over the wine-hall and these words spoke:

"Never, since I could raise hand and shield, have I entrusted to any man this noble Danes' hall, except now to you. Have and hold this best of houses, bring glory to it, watch for foes with mighty courage. You shall not want for anything if you survive this courageous work!"

Then Hrothgar, protector of the Scyldings, departed with his troop of heroes from the hall. The war-chief wished to join Wealhtheow, his queen and bedmate. The glorious king had, as men learned, set a hall-guardian against Grendel; he performed special service for the lord of the Danes, warding the giants away.

Indeed, the prince of the Geats firmly trusted his bold strength and the Almighty's favor. He took off his iron byrnie and his helm, gave his ornate sword, best of blades, to a thane for safekeeping, then bade him watch his war-gear. Beowulf of the Geats, that good man, spoke some braving words before he lay down on his bed:

"I count myself no lesser in war-strength, in grim war-deeds, than Grendel deems himself. So I will not put him to sleep with a sword, deprive him of life, though I easily might. He knows not the arts of war, how to strike back against me, hew my shield, though he has courage in evil works. But we two shall forgo swords in the night if he dares seek war without weapons - and wise God, the holy Lord, shall allot the mastery on whichever hand He thinks proper!"

The battle-brave hero bent down his cheek then, the bolster received that warrior's face and around him many a keen sea-fighter sank to his rest on the hall-couch. None of them expected he would ever again visit his cherished home, his kith or country where he was raised, for they had heard how a bloody death in the wine-hall had carried off too many of the Danish people before.

But the Lord gave them comfort and help, support and success, to the Weders' people so that, through the strength of one, his sheer power, they all overcame their foe. The truth is made known that mighty God has always ruled over mankind.

In dark night that wraith came gliding, the shadow-stalker. The guardsmen slept, all those who should watch over the horn-gabled hall - all except one. It was well known among men that the fiend could not drag them to the shades when the Creator willed it not.
But he, ever-vigilant in hating mind, wrathful and ravenous, awaited the battle's outcome.

Then from the moor under misty hills, Grendel came prowling under the weight of God's anger. That wicked ravager planned to ensnare many of the race of men in the high hall. He strode under the clouds until he could see most clearly the wine-hall, treasure-house of men, shining with gold-plates. This was not the first time he had sought Hrothgar's home. Never in his life before or since did he find worse luck with hall-thanes!

The creature, bereft of joys, came striding to the hall. The door, fastened by fire-forged bands, sprang open at once when he touched it with his hands. Evil-minded, swollen with rage, he ripped open the mouth of the building. Quickly then the fiend stepped onto the bright-patterned floor, warped with fury. A fire like light flared in his eyes. He saw many men in the hall, a band of kinsmen asleep all together, young warriors. His mind laughed - the villain intended to sever the life from the body of each one before day came. He expected a plentiful meal.

It was his fate that he would feed on no more of mankind after that night. The mighty man Hygelac's kinsman, watched closely how the murderous foe would proceed with his sudden snatches. The monster did not mean to delay but seized a sleeping warrior for his first move, tore him apart at once, chomped muscle, drank blood from veins, swallowed him in huge lumps. Quickly he had devoured all the dead man, even feet and hands.

Forward he stepped, reaching out his hand towards the good man on his bed. The fiend intended to snatch with his claws that wakeful warrior. But Beowulf at once perceived his purpose and propped himself up on his elbow. Swiftly the evil creature realized that never before in this middle-earth, this wide world, had he met a man whose hand-grip was harder. In his heart he grew fearful, his mind filled with dread, but he could not escape soon enough. He wished to flee to his den, seek the company of devils - his circumstances there were unlike any he had known before in his lifetime.

Hygelac's noble thane then called to mind his evening speech. He stood upright and seized Grendel tight. His fingers burst; the monster made to move away, the man stepped forward. The famous creature thought to slink off somewhere, to flee into his fen-lair, but he knew his fingers' strength was in the grip of an angry foe.

What a terrible trek that was for that harm-doer to Heorot!

The lordly hall thundered. The building shook. A huge clamor arose as terror seized all the Danes living in that fortress, nobles and brave men alike. Both the enraged hall-guardians were exceedingly fierce; the building echoed. It was a great wonder the wine-hall withstood the battle-beasts, that the fair earthen-house did not fall to the ground - but craftsmen had braced it so firmly both within and without with iron bands that it endured. There many mead-benches adorned in gold crashed down from their platforms, as I have heard tell.

Before that, the counselors of the Scyldings had supposed no man by any means might shatter that splendid building embellished with antlers, destroy it by craft - unless the embrace of fire swallowed it in flames. A new sound arose - the North-Danes endured the terrible fear, each one of them, who from the wall heard weeping, God's adversary howling a wretched song, Hell's prisoner bewailing his wound.

He who was mightiest of men in his day held him too firmly for that slaughterer to escape. The protector of nobles would in no way let that deadly visitor leave alive, reckoning his days useful to none of the people.

Then many a young warrior of Beowulf's drew his old heirloom sword; they would save their lord's life, that renowned prince, however they could. They did not know, those brave warriors as they joined the fray, hacking away hard, that no battle-sword could harm that wicked raider - for he had enchanted all swords' edges, every blade, by spells. His death on that day in this mortal world would be wretched, and the alien spirit would wander far into fiends' keeping.

Then he who before had wrought much malice against mankind - he warred with God - found out that his body would serve him no longer; Hygelac's bold kinsman had him by the hand. Each was hateful to the other while alive. The gruesome monster suffered a body-wound; a gaping rent appeared in his shoulder, his sinews sprang apart, his joints burst. Glory in battle was granted to Beowulf. Grendel, mortally hurt, had to flee thence under the fen-slopes, seek out his joyless abode. He knew more surely then that his life's end was come, his days numbered. The desire of all the Danes had been fulfilled by that bloody battle.

There Beowulf had purged Heorot of affliction, warded off attack - he who had come from afar, wise and stout-hearted, had saved the hall from ravage. He rejoiced in his night-work, his fame for bravery. The Geats' leader had made good his boast to the East-Danes, relieving all their sorrows, the harrowing they had suffered and were forced to endure, no small distress. A clear proof of this, when the gallant man laid down that hand, that arm and shoulder - all of Grendel's claw was there together under that great roof!

### Celebrations

In the morning, as I have heard, there were many warriors around the gift-hall. Chieftains from far and wide came over distant roads to survey the wonder, the monster's footprints. None rued his demise who tracked him to the mere where he had fled, beaten in battle, doomed and driven off, the water welling with blood, its heaving surges all mingled with hot gore. The fated one, deprived of bliss, gave up his heathen soul and lay there, lifeless, in his fenny lair, where Hell received him.

Later the proud warriors rode their steeds back from the mere, young men together on their pale horses. There was talk of Beowulf's fame - many often said that no man under all heaven's span, the wide seas, was worthier of rule, a better king. They did not blame their gracious lord, kind Hrothgar - he was a good king!

At times the bold in battle let their tawny horses run races where the ground seemed suitable for a gallop. At times a king's thane, a man laden with fame, one who recalled tales of old, found new words, bonded truly, then began fluently to weave stories. He recited with wisdom Beowulf's deed, and skillfully composed a fitting tale with embellished sayings.

He told all that he'd heard told of Sigemund's famous feats, much that was unknown - the wars of Wæls' son, his wide wanderings, which men did not know well, his feuds and crimes. Only Fitela, his nephew, stood by him when the gallant warrior swung his sword against the kin of monsters. With their mighty blades they killed many of the giant's clan. After his death Sigemund gained no small glory when, hardy in battle, he slew the serpent, guardian of the hoard. Under the gray stone he ventured that princely deed alone, not even Fitela with him. Yet he managed to pierce the wondrous worm with his blade so that it stuck fast in the wall, the noble iron. The drake died by violence.  

The hero had won by his own daring to use the ring-hoard as his heart desired. He loaded a sea-boat, bore into its bosom shining ornaments, Wæls' heir did. The serpent melted in its own heat. Sigemund was widely famed for his deeds of valor, his battle-exploits. After Heremod's war-might declined, his strength and courage, he was betrayed to the Jutes, quickly driven off. Sorrows in surging waves afflicted him too long. He became a burden for his people, all his nobles. Often in earlier times many a prudent man mourning his troubles had yearned for the lost hero's help, for him, the king's son, to succeed to his father's rule, take charge of the folk, the hoard and sheltering stronghold, kingdom of men, homeland of the Scyldings.

Beowulf was more dear to all mankind, to friends and allies. Malicious crimes had chased away Heremod! At times in play proud warriors raced their steeds along sandy paths. Daylight, much welcome, sped onward then. Many a brave man sought the high hall to see the wondrous treasures. The king himself from his queen's chambers, guardian of the rings, strode in majesty, famed for his virtues, attended by a troop of thanes and his queen with a train of maidens.

Hrothgar spoke - he went to the hall, stood at the pillar, looked at the steep roof decked in gold and at Grendel's arm:

"Let thanks forthwith be given to God for this sight! I have suffered long at Grendel's hands - God may always work wonder after wonder, the Guardian of Glory!

It was not long ago that I expected never to be relieved of any woes in my life when this best of halls stood blood-drenched, stained in gore: widespread woe for all my wise men who hoped this bright building would never fall, ruined by cruel foes. Now a warrior through the Lord's might has performed a deed we could not manage in our wisdom. Lo, a lady who brought forth this flower of manhood may say, if still alive, that the God of the Ages was gracious to her in child-bearing.

Now, Beowulf, best of men, I adopt you in my heart as a dear son. From now on hold well this new kinship. You shall not lack earthly rewards that I command. Full often for lesser deeds I have given compensation to a weaker warrior, one poorer in prowess. You have ensured by your exploits that your fame shall endure through all the ages. May Almighty God requite you with good as He yet has done!"

Beowulf gave answer, Ecgtheow's son:

"In great goodwill we achieved this fight, boldly dared an encounter with this unknown foe. I wish you could have seen the creature himself in his trappings, struggling to escape! I thought to pin him down quickly on his deathbed with a firm grip so that he lay within my grasp, gasping for life - but his body escaped. I could not keep him from going since God did not will it, I could not cling to that deadly foe firmly enough; that fiend was too powerful in his going. Yet in saving his life he left his hand, his arm, and his shoulder as a token of his visit - but that wretched creature won no respite there!

No easier will he survive the wound though his lifespan is extended wretchedly by evil - sin grips him tightly, snares him in its bonds. There that stained wretch, so crippled by sin, must await a mighty doom, to see how glorious God shall decree an end to his days."

Then that son of Ecglaf fell silent in his speech, his daring deeds of combat, once those noble men saw with their own eyes that hand on the rafters - that foe's fingers, in front of all of them. Each sturdy-nailed talon on that heathen's claw was like pure steel - the men declared not one of them would wound it, the battle-hardened blade, best of swords, that was made to harm that hideous claw!

Then they commanded the hall be speedily hand-adorned, many men and women toiled, the wine-hall to deck. Gold shone on the walls, wondrous sights for all who gaze on such. That bright building was badly broken, though fast within and without with iron bands. The hinges were wrenched - the roof alone was sound when the wretch turned to flee, hopeless for life.

No easy thing it is to escape death, strive as one may - each of us must seek that inevitable place where the body, after the banquet of life, sleeps fast in the tomb.

Then came the due time that Healfdene's son should go to the hall. The king himself wanted to partake of the feast. Never have I heard that any people in greater company gathered more courteously around their ring-giver! The renowned ones took their places on the benches, rejoiced at the banquet. Hrothgar and Hrothulf, their kinsmen, quaffed many a mead-cup in the high hall, Heorot now filled with friends within. No treacherous deeds did the Scyldings there attempt.

Then the son of Healfdene bestowed on Beowulf a gilded banner as victory's prize, a decorated battle-flag, a helmet and byrnie, a great treasure-sword many saw them bear before the hero. Beowulf drained the cup on the floor - he need feel no shame in receiving those precious gifts before the warriors! Not often have I known at the ale-bench four such gold-adorned treasures given in friendship to other men.

Around the crown of the helm head-protection wound with wires kept guard outside over the head so that no tempered blade might harm it when the shield-bearing warrior had to go forth against his foes.

Then the protector of nobles ordered eight steeds with gold-plated bridles be brought into the hall, into the enclosure. On one of them rested a saddle skillfully decorated, adorned with jewels. That was the battle-seat of the high king when Healfdene's son wished to join in the play of swords. Never did the fighting spirit of that famed man falter in the front when corpses fell!

And then Hrothgar, protector of Ingwines, gave possession of both to Beowulf - the horses and weapons - bade him use them well. So manfully the famous prince, hoard-guard of heroes, paid for that rout with steeds and treasures so that none could ever speak ill of him who wanted to say the truth according to what's right.

Moreover, the protector of warriors gave treasures from his own inheritance to each one on the mead-bench who had made that sea-journey with Beowulf, old heirlooms and ordered that gold be paid for the one that Grendel wickedly slew, as he would have killed more of them had not mindful God and the hero's courage prevented that fate. The Creator guided all the race of men, as He still does. Understanding is always best, forethought of mind. He who long enjoys this world in these days of strife should endure much, both love and hate.

There was the sound of music, the clear song of the poet. The servers poured wine from wondrous vessels. A poet sang, reciting the tale of Finn's offspring for the pleasure of the hall - when sudden attack came upon them, Hnæf of the Scyldings, hero of the Half-Danes, had to fall in Frisian slaughter. Nor did Hildeburh have much cause to praise the good faith of the Jutes. Blameless, she was bereft of loved ones, sons and brother, in that shield-play, wounded by spears they fell as fate doomed them.

That was a mournful lady! Not without reason did Hoc's daughter lament fate's decree when morning came, when under the sky she saw the slaughter of her kinsmen lie there. War had taken all but a few of Finn's thanes; he could not in the meeting-place fight any war at all with Hengest, nor save by battle the survivors from the prince's thane. But they offered him terms, that they would fully furnish another hall, make it their own, and Finn, son of Folcwald, would daily at the dole-giving honor the Danes, grant Hengest's troops rings and treasures, even as much shining plate-gold as he would bestow on the Frisians in the beer-hall.

They swore a treaty on both sides, a firm compact of peace. Finn, being lordless, boldly declared oaths to Hengest that he would hold the survivors in honor by the judgment of his councilors, that no man there by word or deed should break the pact or ever mention it maliciously, though they followed the slayer of their own ring-giver, being lordless. If any of the Frisians with reckless speech brought that murder to mind, then the sword's edge should avenge it.

The oath was taken and treasures of gold were brought from the hoard. The best of the Battle-Scyldings was ready for the pyre. At that fire was easily seen the blood-stained mail-shirt, the swine all-golden, the boar iron-hard, many an noble destroyed by wounds. Some had fallen in battle.

Then Hildeburh had her own son placed on Hnæf's funeral pyre to be burned, his body put to the flames. The lady lamented, mourned in songs. The warrior ascended. The greatest of funeral fires rolled up to the clouds, roared before the mound. Heads melted, wounds opened and burst, as blood sprang out. The greediest of spirits swallowed all those whom war destroyed of both folks. Their glory was departed.

The warriors then went, bereaved of friends, to seek their dwellings, to see Friesland, their homes and high city. But Hengest still through the death-stained winter dwelt with Finn, loyally he kept to his home. He thought of the homeland, though he could not drive on the sea his ring-necked prow. The sea surged in storms, strove with the wind. Winter locked the waves in icy bonds until another year came to the dwellings, as it still does, the glory-bright weather that steadfastly observes the seasons.

Then winter was gone, the bosom of earth was fair. The exile, the guest, was eager to leave - but more did he think about vengeance than sea-voyaging, if he might bring about a fatal meeting, for he bore in mind the Jutes. Thus he did not refuse the world's destiny when Hunlafing placed on his lap the best of blades, its edges well-known among the Jutes - and such were the savage sword-slayings at Finn's own home.

Later Finn himself, the king in his courtyard, fell to the sword. The bold-hearted Guthlaf and Oslaf, after a sea-journey, told of this sorrow, blamed him for their share of woes. His wavering spirit could not hold firm in his breast. Then was the hall reddened with blood of enemies, Finn was slain, the queen taken. The Scylding warriors bore to their ships all the possessions of that king of the land, whatever they could find in Finn's home of jewels and gems. Over the sea-roads they bore the royal lady back to the Danes, led to her people.

The lay was sung, the gleeman's story done. Delight rose up, bench-joy brightened. Servers poured wine from wondrous vessels. Then Wealhtheow came forth, walking under a golden crown to where the two good men sat, uncle and nephew - their peace was still whole, each true to the other. Unferth the spokesman sat at the feet of the Scylding lord. All people trusted his spirit, that he had great courage, though he was not honorable in sword-play with other men.

Then the lady of the Scyldings spoke: "Take this cup, my beloved lord, giver of treasure. Be glad, gold-friend of men, and speak to the Geats with mild words as man should do. Be gracious to the Geats, mindful of gifts. Near and far you now have peace. I have been told you wish this hero to be your son. Heorot is cleansed, the bright ring-hall. Dispense while you may many rewards, and to your kinsmen leave folk and realm when you must go forth to meet your fate.

I know my gracious Hrothulf will guard the young ones well if you, friend of the Scyldings, leave the world earlier than he. I expect him to repay our children well, if he remembers all that we two have done in the past for his pleasure and honor when he was a child."

She turned then to the bench where her sons were, Hrethric and Hrothmund, and the sons of nobles, the youth all together. There the good man sat, Beowulf of the Geats, between the brothers.

The cup was carried to him, friendly words spoken, and twisted gold graciously offered - two arm-bangles, rings and mail, and the greatest necklace I have heard tell of on earth. I heard of no finer hoard-treasure of heroes under the sky since Hama bore off to his bright city the Brosing's necklace, jewel and setting. He fled the cunning plots of Eormanric, choosing gain eternal.

Hygelac of the Geats, grandson of Swerting, had the ring on his last raid when under his banner he defended his treasure and sustained mortal wounds. Fate swept him away when he in his pride sought trouble, feud with the Frisians. Over the cup of waves that mighty king bore the treasure, precious stones. He fell under his shield. Then the king's body came into the Franks' possession, his breast-mail and the ring together. Lesser warriors stripped the corpse after the slaughter. The Geats' bodies covered the field.

The hall resounded. Wealhtheow spoke before the company:

"Take delight in this torque, dear Beowulf, young man, in this armor, and use them well. Prosper and show manly virtue! Be kind in guidance to these youths. I will remember your rewards. You have brought it about that men shall give you honor in all things far and near, as widely as the seas encircle the windy walls of the land. Be, while you live, a prosperous prince! I wish you well with these treasures. Be kind to my son, guarding his joys. Here each comrade is true to the other, gentle in spirit, loyal to the lord. The thanes are obedient, the people all ready. Warriors well-drunken, do as I bid!"

She went then to her seat. There was choicest of feasts, the men drank wine. They knew not cruel destiny, the evil shaped for many a noble man, as evening drew on and Hrothgar departed for his rest, the mighty king for his evening repose. Countless heroes guarded the hall as they had often done before - they cleared away the bench-boards, spread out beds and bolsters throughout the hall. One beer-servant, doomed and fated, lay down to his rest.

At their heads they set their battle-shields, bright bucklers. There on the bench was easily seen over each noble the towering helmet, the ringed mail-shirt, the mighty spear-shaft. It was their custom to be ready for war both at home and on raids, at every time their lord had need.

That was a good people!

### A Mother

They sank then to sleep. One sorely paid for his evening's rest, as had often happened when Grendel guarded that gold-hall, wreaking evil until his end came, death for his sins. It then became evident, widely known to men, that an avenger still lived after that fiend. For a long time Grendel's mother, a monstrous hag, brooded on her wrongs. She who had to dwell in the dreary waters, cold sea-streams, since Cain cut down with his sword his only brother, his father's son - he fled then marked by that murder, banished from men's joys, and dwelt in the wasteland.

From him awoke all those dire breeds: ogres and elves and evil phantoms, giants too who fought against God for a long while. He gave them their reward!

She went then on a grievous journey, that mother of Grendel, to avenge her son's death. She came then to Heorot where the Ring-Danes slept throughout the hall. A sudden reversal came to men there when Grendel's mother burst in upon them. The terror was less by just as much as a maiden's strength, a woman's war-terror, is less than an armed man's when the hefted sword, hammer-forged, stained with blood, sharp-edged, shears through the boar on an opponent's helmet.

Then hard-edged swords were drawn from sheaths, many a broad shield raised strongly in hand. None thought of helm or broad byrnie when terror seized them. The hag was in haste, she wanted to get out from there with her life protected once she was discovered. Quickly she had seized one of the nobles tight when she went to the fen. He was to Hrothgar the dearest of heroes in the ranks of his comrades between the seas, a powerful shield-warrior, whom she killed as he slumbered, a renowned fighter.

Beowulf was not there. Another house had been assigned to the mighty Geat after the gift-giving. There was an outcry in Heorot. The bloody-handed hag had taken their trophy. Sorrow was renewed, come again to their dwellings. The trade was not good that they on both sides should barter with the lives of loved ones.

Then the wise king, the hoary warrior, was sorrowful in heart when he learned his chief thane, his dearest one, no longer lived. Beowulf was quickly summoned to the bedchamber, that bairn of triumph. The noble hero went at first light with his warrior-comrades to where the wise king waited to see if the All-Ruler would ever bring about a turn in his woe after that news of disaster.

The hero famed for his battle-prowess went with his hand-picked troop along the hall-floor - the wooden building resounded - to greet the wise king with courteous words, the lord of the Ingwines, to ask if his night had passed in peace despite the pressing need.

Hrothgar, protector of the Scyldings, spoke:

"Ask not of joy! Grief has renewed for the Danish people. Æschere is dead, elder brother of Yrmenlaf, my sage adviser and keeper of counsel, my shoulder-companion when we in battle defended our heads, when troops clashed and helmets hammered. An earl should be as he was, a far-famed noble!

A wandering death-spirit slaughtered him in Heorot. I know not where that cruel creature, exulting in carrion, has gone in retreat, rejoicing in her prey. She has avenged the feud in which you slew Grendel last night by violently crushing him, since he too long diminished and destroyed my people. He fell in battle, forfeited his life. Now another has come, a mighty man-slayer, to avenge her kin. She has further established the feud, as it may seem to many a thane who with his lord mourns in spirit the treasure-giver, now that the hand lies low that well bestowed all your desires.

I have heard land-dwellers, my people, hall-counselors, say that they have seen two such mighty stalkers of the marshes, alien spirits. One of them, as they could most clearly perceive, bore the likeness of a woman. The other misshapen being trod the paths of exile in the form of a man, except he was huger than any other man. In olden days the people named him Grendel. They knew of no father, whether any was begotten for him by dark spirits.

They guard a hidden land: wolf-haunted slopes, windy headlands, the treacherous fen-path where the mountain stream goes down under the darkness of the hills, the flood under the earth. It is not far from here, measured in miles, that the mere stands. Over it hang groves rimed with frost, a firm-rooted wood overhangs the water.

There each night one may witness a dire wonder, fire on the flood. No man lives so wise that he knows the bottom. Though the heath-stepper, the strong-horned stag, pressed by hounds, seeks out that forest, chased from afar, he will sooner yield up his life, his last breath on the bank, before he will hide his head in it. That is no pleasant place!

Thence the surge of waves rises up dark to the clouds when the wind stirs up terrible storms, until the air grows gloomy, the heavens weep. Now once again help depends on you alone. You do not yet know the land, the perilous place, where you may find that sinful creature. Seek it if you dare! I will reward you for that fight with old-time treasures, twisted gold, as I did before, if you come away alive."

Beowulf, son of Ecgtheow, spoke:

"Sorrow not, wise one! It is better for each to avenge his friend than much mourn. Each of us must await the end of worldly life - let him who may win renown before death. That is the best memorial for a mighty man after he is gone.

Arise, kingdom's guardian! Let us quickly go to view the trail of Grendel's kinsman. I promise you: he will not escape to any hiding place, neither in earth's embrace, nor in the mountain wood, nor on the sea bottom. This day you may wait in patience through whatever woes he intends!"

Then the old man leapt up and thanked God, the mighty Lord, for what that man had spoken. A horse was bridled for Hrothgar, a steed with curly mane. The wise prince rode out in stately fashion. The troop of shield-bearing men marched forth. Footprints were clearly seen along the forest-path, her trail across the lands. She had gone forth, right over the murky moor, bearing the lifeless body of that thane most dear to Hrothgar of all men in his comitatus.

Then the bairn of princes passed over steep stone-banks, narrow gullies, constricted headlands, the abode of water-monsters. He went in front with some few wise men to view the mere, until he suddenly came upon mountain trees overhanging the gray rock, a cheerless wood. The water stood beneath, bloody and troubled. All the Danes, all the friends of the Scyldings, each bold spirit, each courageous earl, were grieved at heart - for they were forced to suffer distress, anguish for their noble thanes, once they came upon Æschere's head on that sea-cliff.

The waters seethed with blood and hot gore. The horn at times sang an eager battle-cry. All the troops sat down. They saw in the water many of the serpent-kind, strange sea-dragons swimming the depths. Likewise along the headland-slopes they spied sea-monsters lying, serpents and beasts that often make a perilous journey on the sail-road at morning-time, sea-monsters and sea-wolves that had sprawled on the shore's cliffs when dawn came, savage and cruel. They fled away, bitter and swollen with rage, at the blast of the battle-horn.

One the lord of the Geats parted from life with his bow, his sea-arrow piercing the surging waves so it was slower in swimming. On the waves it was savagely thrust at with barbed boar-spears, firmly seized and dragged on the headland, the curious lake-roamer. Men looked on that loathsome one.

Beowulf put on his armor, not fearing for his life! His war-byrnie, hand-woven and wide, was destined to explore the deeps - that which could guard his bone-locker, so that no battle-grip could harm his heart, no hostile clutch crush his life. And the gleaming helmet guarded his head, that which should mingle with the mere-depths, seek the surging waters, with treasure adorned, encircled with noble chains, as a weapon-smith had wrought it in bygone days, wondrously worked it, set it round with boar-shapes so that afterward no brand nor battle-sword could bite it.

Nor was that the least of mighty aids that Hrothgar's spokesman lent him in his need! The name of that hilted sword was Hrunting. It was preeminent among ancient treasures. Its blade was iron, patterned with poison-twigs, hardened by battle-blood. Never had it failed any man in battle who brandished it, who dared to venture on paths of terror, the meeting-place of foes. That was not the first time it was destined to do a deed of valor.

Indeed, the son of Ecglaf, strong in his might, did not recall what he had said before when drunk with wine, when he loaned that weapon to a better swordsman. He himself did not dare risk his life under the turmoil of the waves, to do a hero's deed. There he lost the glory, the renown for valor. It was not so with that other when he armed himself for battle.

Beowulf, son of Ecgtheow, spoke:

"Wise son of Healfdene, noble king, now that I am eager to set forth, gold-friend of men, recall what we two spoke of: if I must lose my life in helping your cause, you would always be in the place of a father to me when I am gone. Be guardian to my young thanes, my close companions, if battle should seize me. Likewise, dear Hrothgar, send the gifts you have given me to Hygelac. Then may the lord of the Geats perceive by that gold, Hrethel's son may see when he stares at that treasure, that I found a ring-giver of virtue, rejoiced in his gifts! And let Unferth have that ancient heirloom, the wondrous wavy-patterned sword. I will achieve renown with Hrunting, or death will take me!"

After those words, the lord of the Weder-Geats hastened with valor, not waiting for reply. The surging waters engulfed the warrior. It was a good part of the day before he could see the bottom of the mere.

Soon that fiend who had revelled all her life in the terror of the waters found that a man from above was scouting out her ground-home. She reached for him then, grasped at the warrior with grim claws. Yet she did not harm his sound body - the ring-mail shielded him without so she could not pierce that armor-shirt with her hateful fingers.

Then the mere-wolf bore the prince of rings to her dwelling when she reached bottom, so that for all his courage he could not wield his weapons, but many a monster harassed him in the water, many a sea-beast battered his war-shirt with battle-tusks, pursuing the hero.

Then the noble man found he was in some sort of battle-hall where no water harmed him at all. He could not feel the sudden rush of that flood because the roofed hall kept out the lake's surge. He saw a fire-light, a gleaming blaze shining brightly.

Then the hero perceived that monstrous whelp of the sea-depths, that mighty mere-woman. He made a great battle-rush with his sword. His hand did not hold back the stroke so that the ringed blade sang a greedy war-song on her head. But the guest found that his battle-flame would not bite, not harm her life - the blade failed the prince in his need. It had endured many hand-to-hand meetings before, often shearing through helmets, the war-garb of the doomed. This was the first time that precious gift had failed of its glory.

Hygelac's kinsman, not daunted at heart, was mindful of glorious deeds. The angry warrior threw down that blade bound in jewels, strong and steel-edged on the ground, for he trusted in his strength, his mighty hand-grip. So must a man do when he thinks to gain enduring fame in war - he will not worry for his life!

Then the lord of the War-Geats seized Grendel's mother by the shoulder - he did not mourn that deadly battle! The stout-hearted warrior, hard in his hand-grip, threw down his life's foe so she fell to the floor. Quickly she paid him back his reward in cruel clasps and grappled him to her. Weary in mood, the strongest of fighters, of foot-soldiers, stumbled and fell.

Then she sat upon that hall-guest and drew her dagger, broad and bright-edged. She would avenge her son, her only offspring. His woven breast-armor lay on his shoulder. It saved his life, withstood the entrance of point and blade. There the son of Ecgtheow would have perished under the wide ground had his battle-byrnie not afforded him help, his hard war-net, and holy God brought about war-victory. The wise Lord, Ruler of the heavens, decided it rightly, easily. Beowulf stood up again.

Then he saw among the armor a victory-blessed blade, an old sword of the giants, strong of its edges, glory of warriors. It was the choicest of weapons - but it was larger than any other man could carry to battle-sport. It was good and splendid, a work of the giants. He seized the linked hilt then, the Scyldings' champion fierce and sword-grim. Despairing of life, angrily he drew the ring-sword, struck in fury so it bit deep in her neck, broke the bone-rings. The blade cut through that fated body. She fell to the floor. The sword was gory - the man rejoiced in his deed.

A light shone, sheer as from the sky, steady and bright as is heaven's candle. He gazed about the vault, turning to the wall - angry and resolute he heaved up the sword holding it hard by its hilt, Hygelac's thane. The blade was not useless to the battle-warrior but he wished to speedily repay Grendel for the many attacks he had launched on the West-Danes - oftener by far than a single time when Hrothgar's hearth-comrades he slaughtered in their slumber, devoured fifteen of the Danes in their sleep and bore off as many, a cruel prey.

He had paid him back, that fierce champion, so now he saw Grendel lying lifeless, weary of war, bereft of life - as the battle at Heorot had scathed him before. Grendel's corpse sprang far when after death he suffered a blow, a hard sword-stroke. Thus he cut off his head.

Soon the wise men saw from the cliff with Hrothgar the surging waters mingling in a maelstrom, dyed in blood. The old gray-haired ones spoke together about the good hero, how they did not expect that princely man would come back again seeking the renowned ruler in victory - to many it seemed the sea-wolf had slain him.

Then came the ninth hour of the day. The bold Scyldings left the headland. The gold-friend of men went home from there. The outsiders sat, sick at heart, staring at the mere. They wished but did not expect to see their dear lord himself.

Then that sword, the blade, began to dissolve in gore-spatterings from that war-monster after battle-toil - it was a wondrous sight how it all melted, most like to ice when the Father unties the frost-fetters, unleashes the floods. He is the true ruler of seasons and times - He, the Creator of the world.

The hero of the Weder-Geats took no treasures from that vault, though many he saw - save only that head, and the hilt shining with gold. The blade had melted, the patterned sword had burned away so hot was that blood, so poisonous that alien spirit who perished there.

Soon he was swimming, he who survived the foe's onslaught. He dived up through the water. The surging waves were cleansed, the vast expanse, when that outsider let go his life and this fleeting world.

He came to shore then, the chief of the sea-men, stout-hearted, swimming - he rejoiced in his sea-spoil, in the mighty burden he bore with him.

His loyal band of thanes went to meet him, thanking God that they could see him safe and sound. Quickly their hero's helmet and byrnie were unbound. The lake subsided, water under the clouds, stained with gore.

They set forth from there on the path they had followed, glad in mind, measuring the ground, the well-known ways. Boldly they bore the head from the sea-cliff, toiling to carry it - a task for four of the battle-keen men, on the slaughter-pole to heave Grendel's head to the gold-hall.

Forthwith they came striding on to the hall, fourteenth in line, those daring men, the lord of the Geats in their midst treading the mead-plains. The chief of the thanes,
the valiant man, bade greetings to Hrothgar.

Then Grendel's head was borne by the hair into the hall where the men were drinking, an awful sight for the earls and the lady with them. The men stared at that wondrous spectacle.

### Trophies

Beowulf, son of Ecgtheow, spoke:

"Lo and behold! Scion of Healfdene, lord of the Scyldings, we have joyfully brought you this sea-booty which here you gaze on, token of glory. I hardly escaped with my life. Under water I ventured on that arduous deed, the battle would have gone badly had God not shielded me.

I could do nothing with Hrunting in that fight though that weapon is still worthy. But the Ruler of Men granted me to see hanging on the wall a fair, ancient great-sword - most often He has guided men bereft of friends - so that I drew that weapon. Then I slew in that struggle, as occasion served me, the guardians of that house.

That battle-blade then burned away, that patterned sword, as the blood gushed forth, hottest of battle-gore. I bore away the hilt from my foes, avenged their evil deeds, the Danes' death-fall, as it was fit.

Thus I promise you, you can sleep free from care with your company of thanes in Heorot, and likewise every thane of your people, the veteran and the youth. You need dread, lord of the Scyldings, no threat to your life from that quarter as you once did."

Then to that hoary warlord they gave the gilded hilt, the giant-forged sword given into the hand of that aged prince, the ancient work of smiths. After the fall of those fiends, it passed into the possession of the lord of the Danes, a wondrous work of men. After that furious struggle, after the passing-away of the wicked, the king who of all men in the North-Danes' realm wrought the greatest deeds of valor, guarded his good folk, it went into his keeping.

Hrothgar spoke, gazing on the hilt, ancient heirloom. The inscription told its origin, on which the serpent-twining shone in gold - it said for whom that finest of sword-blades first was wrought with twisted hilt, dragon-adorned.

The wise son of Healfdene began then to speak - all fell silent:

"He may say it who does good and right among the people, far and near remembering the far-off past in his old age, that this earl was born of the better sort!

So shall your glory, my friend Beowulf, be widespread among the nations! You keep your strength in all ways, and with wisdom of mind. I shall maintain for you as we pledged before - you shall ever be a solace to your people, a help to heroes!

Unlike Heremod was Ecgwela's bairn to the honor-armored Scyldings. He did not become a joy to them but a slaughter and a destruction to the Danish people. He slew his table-companions, his own hearth-comrades in a fit of anger till he, that famous prince, wandered forth alone from the joys of men - though mighty God had raised him high above all men in the joys of power and strength, he had promoted him.

Still a savage breast grew in his heart - he gave no rings to the Danes as was proper. Joyless, he suffered in his strife a long while, a woe to his people. Do you learn from him! Understand manly virtue! I, old in winters, have told you this for your sake.

How wondrous that a mighty God through His vast Spirit shares out to mankind wisdom, lands, and high rank - He holds power over all things! Sometimes He lets a man's thought turn to love, gives him an earthly kingdom, a stronghold of men to hold, He puts so wide a portion of the world under his sway, a spreading realm, that the man himself cannot imagine any end to it in his unwisdom.

He lives in plenty, nothing thwarts him - neither sickness nor old age saddens him; no sorrow darkens his mind, nor does strife anywhere, no feud show its hate, but all the world bends to his will.

He knows nothing worse until within him his portion of pride grows and burgeons while that warden, conscience, slumbers - the sleep is too deep, bound in cares. The killer is terribly close who aims his bow with evil intent.

Then he is hit in the heart, struck by the bitter arrow under the armor-shirt from someone's cruel bowstring. Nor can he guard against the crooked commands of that cursed spirit. What he has long held seems too little to him now. Angry-minded, he gives no gold rings for men's honor, and he forgets and neglects the destiny ahead, the ample honors that God, the glorious King, earlier gave to him.

At the end it ever happens that his mortal body droops and falls fey. Another man fills his place who joyfully distributes treasures, that earl's ancient wealth, caring nothing for its former owner.

Guard yourself against baleful envy, dear Beowulf, best of men! Choose that better part, eternal wisdom. Give not way to arrogance, famous champion! Now is your strength's bloom for a while. Soon it will be that sickness or sword will shear your strength from you, or the fangs of fire, or the surge of flood, or the cut of a sword, or the flight of a spear, or dire old age. Or the brightness of your eyes will ebb - at once, O warrior, death will overpower you.

Thus I ruled the Ring-Danes for fifty winters under the clouds, and by much warfare warded them against many nations throughout this middle-earth with ash-wood spears and swords so that I reckoned myself no foe under the far-flung sky. What an upset of things for me in my land, grief of heart, when Grendel, that ancient adversary, became my invader! Because of his onslaughts I suffered continual anguish in spirit, great sorrow of heart. Thanks be to the Creator, the eternal Lord, that I have lived to see with my eyes this gory head after the old war-woe!

Now go to your seat! Share the feast's joy, you who are battle-renowned! There shall be a great multitude of treasures between us when morning comes."

The Geat was glad, at once going to take his seat as the wise king urged him. Then as before, a fair feast was set with many a man for those brave in battle in the beer-hall.

Night's dark helm covered the world till the bright creation of the Almighty came striding over the land, Shadow-Brood from Shadow-March. The warriors rose, the gray-haired king wished to go off to bed, the ancient Scylding. The Geat, the shield-bold man, greatly desired rest after his travails.

Soon the hall-thane, a man charged to conduct him to that far-dwelling weary from his voyaging, eagerly attended to his every need as an ocean-farer would require in that day.

The great-hearted hero slept soundly till the black raven, blithe-hearted, boded heaven's light. Then came bright daylight hastening over the land. The warriors hurried, those chiefs desired again to fare to their own people. The bold-hearted one bade them bring his ship, his well-loved vessel.

Then he commanded Hrunting be borne to the son of Ecglaf, bade him take back his sword, choice iron. He gave thanks for that loan, said he reckoned that war-friend a fine one, powerful in battle. He spoke no ill word about the weapon's edge - he was a great-hearted man.

Now when the warriors were ready in their gear, the chief honored by the Danes went to the high-seat where that other warrior waited - the hero battle-hale gave greeting to Hrothgar.

Beowulf son of Ecgtheow spoke:

"Now we seafarers come from afar desire to declare we are eager to go back to Hygelac. We have been entertained well here to our hearts' content - you have treated us splendidly. If I then on earth may gain by any means more of your heart's love, lord of men, than I have already done in deeds of war, I shall be ready at once!

If I learn over the expanse of waters that neighbors oppress you as once your enemies did, I shall bring a thousand thanes, brave warriors, to help your cause. I know that Hygelac, lord of the Geats, though young as a guardian of his people, will support my needs with word and deed so that I may pay all homage to you and bring to your aid my spear-shaft when men are needed as reinforcements. If Hrethric then repairs to the court of the Geats, he will find many friends there. For the brave, foreign lands are better sought by one who acts worthily."

Hrothgar spoke to him in reply:

"The wise Lord has sent these sayings into your soul! Never have I heard one so young in years speak so wisely in his discourse. You are strong in might and mature in mind, wise in your words. I expect if it comes to pass that a spear, a fierce battle-onslaught, sickness or weapon seizes your lord, Hrethel's heir, the protector of men, and you are yet alive, that the Sea-Geats will have no better king to choose than you - if you will hold that spacious kingdom of your kinsmen.

Your great heart pleases me the longer the better, dear Beowulf. You have brought it about that to both the peoples, the Geats and the Spear-Danes, there shall be common peace and strife will cease, the hostile attacks that they previously endured. While I rule this wide realm, treasures will be in common between us - with loving thoughts and presents our emissaries shall greet one another over the gannet's bath. I know the peoples are firmly-established both towards friend and foe, blameless in every way after the old traditions."

Then the protector of earls, Healfdene's son, gave him twelve treasures in addition in that hall. He bade him then with those gifts seek out his beloved people in safety and quickly return. Then the king of noble lineage, lord of the Scyldings, kissed that best of thanes and clasped him by the neck. Tears fell from him as the old man did so - he had two expectations, but the second was stronger: that they might see each other again, proud princes, in that same place. The man was so dear to him that he could not retain his welling heart but deep in his breast a secret longing after that dear man burned in his blood.

Then Beowulf of the Geats, proud of his gold gifts, glad of treasures, went from that place treading the grassy earth. The sea-goer awaited its lord where it rode at anchor. As they journeyed along the presents of Hrothgar were often praised - he was a peerless king blameless in every way until old age subdued his joyous strength, he who often checked many.

Many proud men came then to the sea - they bore ring-woven coats of mail, linked battle-sark. The coast-guard observed the return of the earls as he did before. He did not greet the guests from that promontory with taunts but rode towards them, declaring that warriors in shining mail went welcome to their ships.

Then on the sand the seaworthy vessel was laden with war-armor, the ringed prow with horses and treasures. The mast rose high above Hrothgar's hoard. The hero gave the boat-ward a sword bound with gold so thereafter he was honored on the mead-bench for that treasure, that sword inherited of old.

He set out into the deep waters, leaving the land of the Danes. There was by the mast a sea-cloth, a sail bound by rope. The sea-wood creaked. The wind over the waters did not hinder the wave-floater from its journey - the sea-goer traveled, the foamy-necked ship went forth over the swell, the bound prow over the ocean currents until they could make out the Geatish cliffs, familiar headlands. The keel pushed up, driven by the wind, stood on the land.

Quickly the harbor-guard was at the shore, he who long before had eagerly watched the dear men's voyage far out at sea. He secured the wide-bosomed ship with anchor-cables fast so the currents of the waves could not heave that winsome boat away.

Then the prince of the Geats bade them bear up the prince's treasure, gold ornaments, and trappings. It was not far from there for them to go to find Hygelac son of Hrethel, where he dwells at home he and his companions near the sea-wall.

That building was splendid, the king lordly, of high renown in halls. Hygd very young was, wise, well-mannered, though few winters had the daughter of Hæreth passed within the palace walls. Yet she was not mean, not sparing of gifts, of precious treasures to the Geatish people.

Modthryth, great queen of the people, performed a terrible wickedness. Bold warriors found no deadly force there for any man daring enough to stare at her openly with his eyes by daylight - he might count on deadly bonds woven by hand being destined for him. Quickly after his seizure the sword was appointed so that the ornamented blade might put an end to it, make known his murder. That is no queenly custom for a woman to practice, peerless though she may be, that a peace-weaver should assail the life of a valued liege-man after a fancied insult. But the kinsman of Hemming put a stop to that.

The ale-drinkers said otherwise, that she did less harm to the people, fewer malicious acts of hate after she was given gold-adorned to the young champion of noble lineage, when at her father's bidding she sought Offa's hall over the fallow flood - there she used well her life's destiny on the throne, famed for her good deeds.

She held high love with that leader of heroes, the best, by all accounts, between the seas of the race of men. Offa was known far and wide for gifts and battles, the spear-bold man wisely ruled his own homeland. From him sprang Eomer, helper of heroes, kinsman of Hemming, grandson of Garmund, mighty in combat.

 The hardy one then went forth with his hand-picked troop to tread the sea-strand, the wide seashores. The world's candle shone, the sun bright from the south. They forged ahead, traveling with vigor until they heard that the protector of earls, the slayer of Ongentheow, the good king, was dealing out rings in his courts. Beowulf's return was quickly made known to Hygelac, that the protector of warriors, his shield-comrade, was coming back there alive and well, going to the court from the battle-play. Quickly room was made for the foot-guests in the hall as the king commanded.

He who had survived the struggle then sat by the king himself, kinsman by kinsman, after his liege-lord with courtly speech had welcomed the loyal hero with mighty words. With mead-cups coursing the daughter of Hæreth moved about that high hall, caring for the company, serving the clear drink to the people.

Hygelac began to question his companion fairly in that lofty hall - curiosity urged him as to what adventures the Sea-Geats had encountered:

"What came of your quest, dear Beowulf, when you suddenly thought to seek a fight far away over the salt water, battle at Heorot? Did you in any way amend that well-known woe for Hrothgar, that famous prince? I brooded with sorrows surging in my heart's waves, mistrusted the journey of my beloved man. I long entreated you not to approach that slaughter-guest at all, let the South-Danes themselves deal with Grendel. I say thanks to God that I may see you safe and sound!"

Beowulf, son of Ecgtheow, spoke:

"It is well-known, my lord Hygelac, to many men, the notorious meeting between Grendel and me, what fight we had upon that field where he had wrought much grief for the Victor-Scyldings, unending misery. I avenged all that so his kin has no cause to boast of that fray at dawn, not he who lives longest of that loathsome kind, snared in sin!

First I came to the ring-hall to greet Hrothgar. Straightaway that famous kinsman of Healfdene, when he knew my intent, assigned me a seat with his own sons. The company rejoiced - never have I seen under heaven's vault hall-guests happier, making merry. At times, that great queen, pledge of peace between peoples, passed through the hall, heartening the young retainers. Often she gave a ring to some man before she went to her seat.

At times Hrothgar's daughter bore the ale-cup before all the court to the high-ranked earls, Freawaru I heard the hall-guests name her as she bestowed the studded treasure. She, young and gold-adorned, is promised to the gracious son of Froda. The Friend of the Scyldings has brought this about, the guardian of the kingdom, and counts it a good plan: with that wife he may settle many slaughters, many feuds. But often and not rarely anywhere after a lord's fall the deadly spear only briefly rests though the bride may be worthy!

It may well displease the prince of the Heathobards and each thane of that people when he with the lady walks through their hall - that his warriors attend a noble scion of the Danes, the heirloom of their ancient fathers gleaming on him - hard and ring-damascened, the Heathobards' treasure, while they could still wield those weapons, until they misled to that shield-play their dear comrades and their own lives.

Then speaks an old spear-warrior who sees the treasure, remembers it all, the spear-death of men - his mood is grim - he begins with mournful spirit to test the mind of the young warrior, to wake his war-fury, and this word he speaks:

'Can you, my friend, recognize that sword, the dear iron your father bore to battle, wearing his helmet for the final time, where the Danes slew him, brave Scyldings held the field of slaughter after Withergild's fall, and the men of our people could not prevail? Now some son or other of those slayers exultantly walks this hall, boasts of that slaughter, bears the treasure which by right you should possess!'

Thus every man will exhort and urge at all times with grievous words until the time comes that the lady's thane for his father's deeds sleeps bloodstained after the sword's bite, losing his life - but the other escapes then, a man knowing well the land.

Then the oaths of earls will be broken on both sides, when deadly hate wells up in Ingeld and the wife's love grows cooler in him after the surges of grief. Therefore I do not count the Heathobards' loyalty sincere, their share in the peace with the Danes a blameless union, their friendship firm.

I shall speak on still about Grendel so that you may know well, giver of treasure, what came of the hand-fight of the men courageous. After heaven's gem had glided over the earth, that furious fiend came in the gloom of the night to attack us where we guarded Heorot quite unharmed.

There deadly violence and unexpected combat befell Hondscio, a mortal wound to that fated man. He first fell, the girded champion - to him, our mighty kinsman, became the murderer's mouthful, devouring the whole corpse of the beloved man. By no means empty-handed would that bloody-toothed slayer, intent on destruction, go from that gold-hall, but he tested his strength against mine, groping wildly. His glove hung broad and strange, secured with cunning clasps, strangely-formed with devil's skills and dragon-skins.

He tried to put me inside, the daring doer of deeds, undeserving, as one of many, but he could not bring that about once I in anger stood upright. It is too long to recount how I repaid that people's killer for each evil deed, how I made good there your people's honor, my liege-lord. He escaped on his way, enjoyed life's comforts for a while. Yet his right hand remained behind in Heorot as a token of his trail, and he, humbled, fell thence in mortal anguish to the mere's bottom.

For that deadly struggle the lord of the Scyldings repaid me with many treasures ornamented with gold when morning came and we had sat down to the banquet. There was music and merriment. The old Scylding, who inquired far and wide, told of the past. At times some hero made the harp's joy ring out, the play-wood sound. At times he told a tale truly and sadly, at times the great-hearted king properly recounted some strange legend, at other times the battle-hardened man, bound by age, lamented his youth and battle-strength - his heart welled within him when, old in winters, he remembered so many things.

So we took our pleasure there that whole day until another night came to men. Then Grendel's mother was quickly ready for revenge, sorrowful set forth - her son death had taken, the Weders' hatred. That wretched wife avenged her boy, killed a warrior boldly - life was gone from Æschere, the aged counsellor.

Nor could the Danes, when morning came, burn the dead man with fire, lay on the pyre that man beloved - she bore that body in a fiend's embrace under the mountain stream. That was the bitterest of griefs for Hrothgar, of heart-sorrows that had long harrowed the leader of his people. Then that prince, heavy in spirit, entreated me by your life to become a hero in that rush of waters, to venture my life, to win glory - he promised rewards for it.

I then found that fell and fearsome guardian of the deep as is widely known. There we two for a time grappled hand-to-hand. The mere seethed with gore and I cut off the head of Grendel's mother in that battle-hall with a mighty sword. I barely got out with my life, but not yet was I doomed. After this the protector of earls, Healfdene's son, gave me many gifts."

"So that people's king lived aright. I lost none of my reward, meed for my strength, for the son of Healfdene gave me treasures according to my own choice, which I will bring to you, battle-famed king, offer them all gladly. Yet again all good things depend on you alone - I have few close kinsmen, my Hygelac, save you!"

Then he bade them bring in the boar's-head standard, the battle-helm high, the gray byrnie, the splendid war-sword, and afterwards made this speech:

"Hrothgar gave me this battle-gear, that wise ruler, bade me first give greetings to you, tell you in words he sent it to you, that mighty man. He said that King Heorogar, ruler of Scyldings, long held this war-dress - yet he would not give the breast-mail to his son, brave Heoroweard though he was friendly to him. Enjoy it all well!"

I heard that to reward that treasure four horses followed, all alike, apple-fallow. He bestowed to Hygelac his wealth and horses. So should a kinsman act, not weave nets of cunning for others nor secretly with wicked skill devise death for his hand-companions. Most loyal to Hygelac, his nephew, was that renowned man and each looked out for the other's good.

I heard that he gave to Hygd the neck-ring, the wondrous treasure wonderfully wrought that Wealhtheow had given him, the prince's daughter, and three horses with it, slender and saddle-bright. Thereafter her breast was adorned with that circlet.

So Ecgtheow's son behaved bold in good deeds, a man known in battles never slaying drunk his hearth-companions. His heart was not cruel but the brave man's spirit guarded with the greatest care that mighty gift God had given him - the strength of heroes. Long was he spurned, the Geats' sons did not regard him in the mead-hall as good for much, nor did the lord of the Weders wish to do him much honor on the mead-bench - they strongly believed he was slack, an unpromising prince. Reversal of every slight came to that brave man!

Then the defender of earls, that famed king, bade Hrethel's heirloom be brought in, adorned with gold - the Geats at that time had no finer treasure in the category of swords. He laid that blade in Beowulf's bosom and gave him seven thousands in gold, a manor and ruling-seat. They both together owned land by birth-right in that nation, a homeland and inherited rights, but the greater right went to him who was higher in rank.

In later days this befell the battle-bold men - Hygelac perished and swords became the bane of Heardred under the shield-wall when among the Scylfings war-hearted Geats sought him out, nephews of Hereric attacking savagely. After that, broad realms came under Beowulf's hand. He ruled well for fifty winters - he was then a grey-haired king, old guardian of his homeland - until one began to hold sway on dark nights, a dragon.

### The Dragon

The dragon ruled a hoard high on a heath, a stone-barrow steep and narrow. Below lay a path little known to men. Some man or other had gone inside there, seized a cup covered in gems from that heathen hoard - he had not concealed it again at least, with his hand stealing the precious treasures, though he had tricked the guardian of the hoard, that sleeping wyrm, with thievish skill.

So that people's invader discovered that wrathful man had woken. Yet there was no purposeful or prudent action when that thief snatched at the treasure, but by dire necessity some slave of I know not which of the children of men, driven by need, fled hostile blows and devoid of a dwelling dared to enter there, a man burdened by sin. He soon found even standing inside filled him with dread.

However that wretched man, prompted by need, stole a cup studded with treasure, and there were many such ancient heirlooms in that earth-cave, as some man in days gone, haunted by thought, had hidden there, the enormous legacy of a highborn race, treasured possessions. Death had taken them all in earlier times and that solitary survivor of their line lingered sorrowfully, waiting for the joy-bestowing treasures though brief was his respite.

The barrow waited there, ready on the plain near the waves, new-made by the headland, secured by cunning arts. Into it the keeper of rings bore the nobles' treasures, a mass of plated gold worth protecting. A few words he spoke:

"Now hold fast, earth, what earls once held and heroes can no more! Indeed, good men obtained it from you at first. Deadly war and fearful carnage seized each of my people, they who had seen the hall's joys - none lives to bear a sword or burnish plated goblets, precious drinking-vessels. The polishers too have passed away. That hard helmet, decked with gold, must lose its platings - its cleaners sleep in death who should keep battle-masks in repair. Likewise, the battle-shirt that endured through clashes on the shield in war amid the bite of swords shall decay after the warrior. No longer can that ringéd byrnie range far and wide on the warlord's side together with heroes. There is no joy of harp, no mirthful lutes, no good hawk swinging through the hall, no swift horse pounding the courtyard. Murderous death has sent forth many mortals on their way."

So, sad at heart, he mourned all his sorrows alone after losing them, unhappy he roamed day and night until death's tide touched at his heart.

That ancient twilight-scather, the burning dragon, found that heathen's hoard standing open, he who hunts barrows, the slick-skinned wyrm who flies at night girt with flames. The country-side folk fear him greatly. He must seek out a hoard in the earth where, rich in years, he guards heathen gold - he gains no good from it!

Thus for three hundred winters that scourge of the people ruled that treasure-house under the earth until a certain man stirred him to wrath, bearing to his liege-lord a plated goblet, asking for a pledge of protection. Then the barrow was searched, the hoard robbed, rings carried off by consent - his lord saw that ancient work of men for the first time.

When the dragon woke, trouble flared again. He sniffed along the stone, stout-hearted found the tracks of his enemy who had stepped unwisely near the dragon's head with stealthy craft. So the heathen's foe, he whose life God's decree spared, survived through cunning and escaped from the dragon's might, hastening from that place.

But the hoard-guardian, coiling and covetous, wished to find the man who had harmed him while sleeping. Hot and fierce he circled the barrow round and round - no man was to be seen in that wilderness, yet he joyed in thoughts of battle and conflict. At times he returned to his barrow and sought the treasure-cup - soon he found someone had found the gold, the noble treasures. With difficulty the hoard-warden waited, wrath-swollen, wanting the man who had done him that wrong to pay with his life for his sleep that night.

Then the barrow's keeper was boiling with fury, the foe wanted to gild that land with flame for his cup. The day had withdrawn to the delight of the wyrm. He no longer wished to wait coiled on the rampart but eager for fire flew forth, girt with flames. Terrifying was the first of those forays to the folk of that land, as it soon would be to their generous giver of treasure.

Then the baleful one began to vomit flames, to burn the bright dwellings - the blaze stood out, terrifying to men. The loathsome air-flyer wished not to leave anything alive. The wyrm's warfare was widely seen, the malice of the cruel foe far and near, how the warring ravager hated and humbled the Geatish people. To his hoard he hurried back then, to his dark hall before day's end. He had surrounded those folk of the land with flame, with fire and burning. He trusted his burg, his battling and his wall - that hope deceived him!

The terrible news was swiftly made known to Beowulf, truly told that his own home, that best of houses, had melted in the waves of flame, the gift-seat of the Geats. That was grief to the good man's heart, the greatest of sorrows in his mind. The wise man believed he must have sorely angered God, the eternal Lord, in some way, breaking ancient law. His breast welled within with black thoughts, which was not usual for him.

The fire-dragon had destroyed with flames the folk's stronghold, that water-walled fastness of the land from without. For this the war-king, the lord of the Weders, devised a revenge. Then he ordered fashioned, protector of warriors, a marvelous war-shield made all of iron. He knew all too well that linden wood from the forest would be no help, no wood could serve against that fire.

That prince renowned for goodness must needs end his fleeting days of worldly life, and the wyrm with him though it long had held sway over that golden hoard. The ring-giver scorned to seek the wide-flyer with a host of men, with a great army. He did not dread that battle at all, nor did he find that serpent's war-power or prowess any cause for fear - for before this Beowulf had survived many chaotic encounters, clashes in battle, once he, that hall's purger, had cleansed Hrothgar's home, triumphing over Grendel's kin, that loathed race.

Nor was that the least of hand-to-hand struggles where men killed Hygelac, when that Geatish king seeking trouble suffered death at the hands of Frisians amidst the battle-rush, lord of the people beaten down by the sword's drink. Beowulf came away from there by his own strength, making use of his swimming skill. He had on his arm alone thirty war-coats when he went into the sea. The Hetware who bore spears against him had no cause to boast of that fight on foot - few came back from that battle-wolf to see their homes!

So Ecgtheow's son, wretched and solitary, swam through the expanse of the waters back to his own people. There Hygd offered him hoard and kingdom, rings and a throne - she did not believe her boy could defend their ancestral seats against foreign hosts now that Hygelac was dead. Yet none of the wretched earls could bring that about with that prince in any way, that he become Heardred's liege-lord or choose to be king.

Still he upheld him among the people with friendly counsel, kindly with honor until he grew older, ruling the Weder-Geats. Banished men, the sons of Ohthere, sought him out over the sea. They had rebelled against the lord of the Scylfings, the best of the sea-kings who dealt out treasure in the Swedish realm, a mighty prince. That marked his end. He, son of Hygelac, received a mortal wound in those feuds, sword-cuts - Heardred fell and then the son of Ongentheow returned to seek out his home once Heardred lay dead. He let Beowulf hold the royal throne, rule those Geats. He was a good king!

Afterwards he considered repaying that young man's fall in later days. He became a friend to Eadgils the wretched, supporting the son of Ohthere over the wide sea with warriors and weapons. He got his vengeance afterwards by bitter forays, robbing the king of life.

Thus the son of Ecgtheow had survived each malicious fight, each fearsome combat until the day when he must meet that dragon in battle. He had gone with eleven others then, that lord of the Geats, angry in mind to view the fire-wyrm. He had learned how that feud arose, that malice to men - the precious cup came into his possession from the hand of the finder.

He was the thirteenth man in that group, he who had caused the beginning of that battle-strife, a captive sad at heart. In desperation he had to point the way to that earth-vault. Against his will did he guide them to that barrow near the surge of waves, that hall under the ground which was filled with exquisite metalwork and filigree. The monstrous guardian, eager for battle, the dread fire-drake, held those golden treasures of old. It is no easy bargain to enter there for any man!

The resolute king, famed for his deeds, then sat on that headland while he bade farewell to his hearth-companions, that gold-friend of the Geats. His soul was mournful, restless and ready for death. Fate was immeasurably near which must meet that old man, seek his soul's treasure, part life from body.

Not long was that leader's spirit enmeshed with flesh. Beowulf spoke, the son of Ecgtheow:

"Many a war-charge have I survived in my youth, many times of battle - I remember them all. I was seven winters old when Lord of Treasure, King Hrethel received me from my father, held me and kept me. He gave me treasure and feasting, mindful of our kinship. While I lived with him I was no less loved as a man in his stronghold than any of his sons, Herebeald and Hæthcyn or my own Hygelac.

For the eldest, a death-bed was unfittingly strewn by his brother's deed after Hæthcyn laid him low with an arrow, his own dear ruler. He missed the mark and shot his kinsman, one brother killed the other with bloody shaft. That was a fight beyond settling, a sin past soothing, sickening to the heart. Yet still, the prince must lose his life unavenged!

So too it is sorrowful for an aged man to live to see his young son's body swing on the gallows. He utters a mournful song, a dirge for his son hanging as a delight for ravens, able to offer no aid to that old man. Every morning he is minded anew of his boy's passing - he has no wish to wait for another heir in his family now that this one through the workings of death has thoroughly experienced deeds of wickedness. Woe-burdened, he beholds his son's lodging, the wine-hall bereft of merriment, wind whistling in the deserted courtyard, no horsemen resting there - warriors and retainers alike sleep in the earth-grave. There is no sound of the harp, no play in the courts as once there had been.

He then turns to his lonely couch, chants a song of sorrow for his lost one, everything seems too empty, the fields and the dwelling-place. Just so the defence of the Weders bore heart-sorrow, misery of mind, after Herebeald's fall. He was powerless to avenge that slaughter on the murderer, nor could he pursue that warrior with hostile deeds though it pained him to do so. He then in sorrow gave up the joys of men, chose God's light. He left to his sons, as a prosperous man does, his lands and towns when he departed this life.

Then there was feud and strife between the Swedes and the Geats, a mutual grievance across the wide water after Hrethel perished. The sons of Ongentheow were bold and battle-eager. They did not wish to keep the peace across the seas but often made terrible raids around Hreosnaburh. My kinsmen avenged those feuds and crimes as was well known, though one of them paid with his life, a heavy price. Hæthcyn, lord of the Geats, fell in that onslaught.

Then I heard at dawn of one brother avenging the other with the sword's edge, where Ongentheow attacked Eofor. The battle-helm split, the aged Scylfing fell, pale and sword-beaten. The hand remembered its share of feuds, did not hold back a deadly stroke. With shining sword, I repaid in war as was granted to me those treasures which he had given me before.

He gave me lands, the joys of a homeland. He had no need to seek out a worse warrior among the Gifthas or the Spear-Danes or in the Swedish realm, to buy with treasure! I would always be at the front of his ranks alone at the vanguard and shall do so my whole life long while this sword endures, which has stood by me early and late ever since I slew Dæghrefn before the hosts with my bare hands, champion of the Hugas. He could not bring to Frisia's king those adornments, that breast-apparel - instead that standard-bearer fell in battle, a prince in his might. The sword's point did not slay him, my hand-grip crushed that knotted bone-house. Now shall the sword's edge, hand and hard blade do battle for the hoard."

Beowulf spoke boasting words a last time:

"I risked many wars in my youth. Now as an old guardian of my people I will still seek strife, do glorious deeds if the evil-doer comes out to me from his earth-hall!"

Then for the last time he greeted each of those bold helmet-wearers, dear comrades:

"I would not bear a sword or weapon against the serpent if I knew another way to grapple with the monster and make good my boast as I did against Grendel. But I expect hot battle-fire there, poisonous breath. For this reason I have shield and byrnie. I will not flee a foot's length from that mound-guardian, but it shall be with us two at the wall as Fate decrees, the Ruler of each man.

I am resolute in mind so that I forgo boasting against that winged warrior. Wait upon the barrow, protected by byrnies, my men in armor, to see which of us two will better survive his wounds after the deadly clash. It is not your task nor fitting for any man except myself alone to measure strength with that monster and do heroic deeds. I shall gain that gold by my courage or battle, that terrible life-bane, will carry off your lord!"

Then the stout warrior rose by his shield, hard under helmet he bore his battle-shirt under the stone cliffs. He trusted his own strength, that of one man - such is not the way of a coward!

Then he who had survived many combats and clashes of war, the crash of the battle-charge, movements of troops, he saw a rocky arch standing near the mound and a stream breaking out from the barrow, surging with battle-fire. No one could survive the dragon's flame to explore near that hoard unscathed for long.

Then from his breast, swollen with rage, the lord of the Weder-Geats let a word burst out. The stout-hearted one stormed - his voice battle-clear rang out under the hoary rock. Hate was stirred, the hoard-guardian discerned a man's voice. There was no more time for parley or peace-making! The dragon's battle-breath first came forth from the stone, hot battle-sweat. The ground resounded. The hero under the barrow lifted his shield against that loathsome foe, the lord of the Geats. Then the ring-coiled serpent was of a mind for battle.

The good war-king drew his sword, the ancient heirloom dull-edged in its ornamentations. The threatening scather of each of those from the other side was seized with dread. The stout-hearted king stood by his tall shield, his defense against the dreadful foe as the wyrm coiled together quickly - he awaited in his war-gear.

Then the burning serpent curved to attack, advancing in coiled form to his fate. The shield well protected life and body for the famed prince a shorter while than he had wished if he was to wield victory in battle on that first day as fate did not decree a glorious victory for him. The lord of the Geats raised his hand, struck the multi-colored horror with his ancient sword so that the bright edge turned on the bone, bit less strongly than its lord, pressed by necessity, had need.

Then after that sword-stroke the guardian of the barrow was in furious heart, spewed deadly fire. The battle-flames shot out far and wide. The gold-friend of the Geats did not glory in victory, his war-sword had failed him, naked in battle as it ought not have done, that iron which had always been trustworthy. That was no easy journey, when that famous son of Ecgtheow was to forsake this earth-plain of his own free will to seek another dwelling-place elsewhere - so must each man give up his fleeting days!

Not long was it until the combatants clashed again. The hoard-guardian took heart, his breast swelled with breath anew. The protector of the people, encompassed by fire, was hard-pressed by the heat. His hand-picked troop of thanes did not band together in bold valor around their battle-lord but slunk into the woods to save their lives. The mind of one alone swelled with sorrows - kinship can never turn aside in one thinking rightly.

Wiglaf was his name, son of Weohstan, a beloved shield-warrior, lord of the Scylfings, kinsman of Ælfhere. When he beheld his lord suffering the heat under his helmet, he remembered those honors which Beowulf had formerly given him, the rich homestead of the Wægmundings, every folk-right which his father possessed. He could not refrain then - his hand seized the shield, that yellow linden wood, and drew his ancient sword, known among men as the heirloom of Eanmund, son of Ohthere. Weohstan had slain that hapless exile, a lordless man, in fair fight with weapon's edge and carried off to his kinsman the burnished helm, ring-locked mail-shirt, and gigantic old sword forged by giants that Onela had given him, his nephew's war-harness, battlegear ready for the fray, not speaking of the feud though he had laid low his own brother's son.

Weohstan held those treasures many a year, the sword and byrnie, until his heir could achieve a heroic deed as his father had done. Then at his passing Weohstan gave to Wiglaf a multitude of war-gear among the Geats, and this was the first time the young champion had gone into the storm of battle with his noble lord. His spirit did not melt within him, nor did his kinsman's heirloom fail in the fight - the dragon discovered that after they met!

Wiglaf spoke, uttered just words, sad at heart, saying to his companions:

"I remember that time we drank mead, when we promised our lord in the beer-hall, he who gave us these rings, that we would repay him for these war-helmets and hard swords if this kind of need befell him, for the helmets and keen blades he chose for us from the army for this expedition of his own will, reminded us of glory and gave me these treasures because he judged us good spear-warriors, keen helmet-bearers, even though our lord, the protector of his people, intended to achieve this mighty work alone because he has performed the most famous deeds among men, the most daring acts. Now the day has come when our lord needs the might of good fighters. Let us go to him, help our war-prince while the grim terror of fire lasts! God knows that for me it is far preferable my body should melt with my gold-giver in the flames. It does not seem fitting to me that we should bear our shields back to our home unless we first fell the foe, defend the life of the Weders' king. I know well those were not the old ways, that he alone of the Geatish strength should suffer distress, sink in battle. Sword and helmet, byrnie and shield shall be shared by both of us!"

He strode then through the death-fumes, bore his battle-helm to aid his lord, spoke a few words:

"Dear Beowulf, may you accomplish all things well, as you did in your youth, as I have heard tell. Do not yield your glory while you live! Resolute in your might, noble lord, defend your life with all strength - I will stand by you!"

After those words the dragon came once more, that dire spirit, garlanded with surging flames to attack his hated foes. The shield was burned to the rim by waves of fire. The byrnie could not give help to the young spear-warrior, but the youth fought on courageously under his kinsman's shield when his own was consumed by the flames.

Then the war-king again struck mightly, enraged in battle. The sword bit hard, shining and ring-patterned, into the dragon's head. But Naegling broke, failed in the fray, Beowulf's sword, old and gray-etched. It was not granted to him that iron blades might help him in battle. Too strong was the hand which, as I have heard, overtaxed every sword with its stroke when he bore a blood-hardened weapon into the fray - it was none the better for him.

Then the people-scather, the terrible fire-dragon, for a third time was mindful of feuds. He rushed upon that mighty man once his chance came, hot and battle-grim. The fiend took his neck in sharp fangs - Beowulf was bloodied with his life-blood, the gore welled out in streams.

Then I have heard in the king's time of need the earl displayed unceasing courage, craft and resolution as was his nature. He did not heed the serpent's head but the stout-hearted man's hand burned as he helped his kinsman so that he struck the malicious foe a little lower down, that man in his armor, in such a way that the gilded sword sank in, gleaming and engraved, and the fire began to subside afterwards.

The king himself still held his senses, wielded his slayer-knife, keen and battle-sharp, which he bore on his byrnie. The defence of the Weders cut the wyrm in two in the middle. They felled the foe - their valor drove out his life and thus they both, noble kinsmen, destroyed him. Such should a man be, a thane in time of need!

That was the last victory for the prince through his own deeds, the end of his work in the world. Then the wound which the earth-dragon had given him began to burn and swell. He soon perceived the vicious blast, the poison welling inside him. The lord went and sat on a seat by the rampart, gazed at the works of giants, saw how the eternal earthen vault upheld within stone arches on pillars.

### Twilight

Then with his hands, his blood-stained sword, that immensely good thane bathed his bloody wounds, his famous king, his friend weary from battle, and unbound his helmet.

Beowulf spoke despite his wound, his mortal injury. He knew full well he had finished his days, his joy in the world. All the length of his days was gone, death was monstrously near:

"Now I would give my war-gear to my son if any heir had been given to follow after me, sprung from my body. I have ruled these people fifty winters. There was not one folk-king among those neighboring tribes who dared meet me with swords or oppress me with terror. I have seen out my time in my homeland, guarded well what was mine, sought no cunning quarrels nor swore any false oaths. I can take joy in all this despite my death-wound, because the Ruler of men need not blame me for murder of kinsmen when my life quits my body.

Now quickly go and view that hoard under the hoary rock, beloved Wiglaf, now the wyrm lies dead, sleeps sorely wounded, plundered of treasure. Hurry now so I may gaze upon that ancient gold-store, closely examine those bright, curious gems so that I may the more easily resign my life and the lordship I have long held because of that hoard."

Then I have heard the son of Weohstan quickly obeyed his wounded lord, battle-sick, bearing his ring-linked corselet, his woven battle-shirt, under the barrow's roof. The victorious young warrior, bold under the mound, saw many precious jewels, glittering gold lying on the ground, wondrous things on the wall and the den of that serpent, the old twilight-flier - bowls lay there, vessels of bygone men bereft of burnishers, deprived of adornment, with none to brighten them. There was many a helm, old and rust-eaten, many arm-rings twisted with skill. Treasure can easily overpower any man, hide it who will! Likewise he saw a banner, all golden, hanging high over the hoard, greatest of wonders woven by hand, gleaming with light so he could scan the floor, examine the jewels. There was no sign of the wyrm there for the sword had carried him off.

Then I heard that one man plundered that hoard, the ancient work of giants in that mound, laid in his arms cups and platters at his own discretion. He took the banner too, brightest of beacons. The blade of his lord, that iron which was old beforehand, had injured him who had been the owner of those treasures for a long time, who had borne that blaze of terror, surging hot before the hoard, until murdered by night.

The messenger was in haste, eager to return, urged by plunder. Curiosity was welling as to whether he would find that great-hearted man still alive in that resting place, deprived of strength where he left him before. So he came with those treasures and found his lord, his gold-giver, bleeding at the end of his life. Again he began to throw water upon him until the point of a word broke through his breast-hoard.

The old man in sorrow gazed at the gold:

"For these riches I give thanks to the Lord of All, the King of Glory, the Eternal Ruler, that I have been allowed to gain such wealth for my people before my death-day. Now I have sold my old life-span for this hoard of treasure. Attend to the needs of the people - I can be here no longer. Order my brave warriors to build a mound, bright after the funeral fire, on a headland by the sea. It shall tower high on Hronesness as a memorial for my people, so that seafarers who drive their tall ships from afar through the ocean's mists will afterwards call it 'Beowulf's Barrow'."

The bold king then undid the golden collar from his neck, gave it to the young spear-warrior; his helmet, his ring, and his byrnie he bestowed to the young thane, bade him use them well.

"You are the last remnant of our kin, the Waegmundings. Fate has swept all my kinsmen away to their doom, those earls in their might. I must follow them."

That was the old man's last word from his breast-thoughts before he chose the funeral pyre, the hot battle-flames. From his breast his soul departed to seek the reward of the righteous.

Then it went hard with the young man to watch his dearest one suffering pain on that bed, lying there at the end of his life. The dragon lay there as well, that terrible beast, bereft of life, oppressed by slaughter. No longer would that coiled serpent rule over treasure-hoards but iron blades had carried him off, hard and battle-sharp hammers' leavings, so that the sky-roamer lay stilled by wounds, fallen near the treasure-chamber. He would never play through the air at midnight, make a boastful showing of himself, glorying in treasure-goods - he fell to the ground because of that warrior's handiwork.

Indeed few men have achieved it, the mightiest of men, though extremely determined in every deed, to run against the breath of a venomous foe or to disturb his treasure hall with their hands if they found the warden on watch, abiding in his barrow. Beowulf had paid with his death for that princely treasure. Both had reached the end of this fleeting life.

Not long afterwards the cowards abandoned the wood, those unsteady oath-breakers, ten together, who had not dared earlier to swing spears in their lord's great need. Ashamed, they bore their shields, their war-garments to where the old man lay. They looked upon Wiglaf.

He sat exhausted, the foot-soldier, near his lord's shoulder, trying to revive him with water, but he did not succeed. Though he wished to on that earth, he could not sustain his leader's life nor change the Almighty's will. The judgment of God directed the deeds of every man then, as He still does now.

Then a grim answer was easy for the young warrior to give to those who had lost their courage. Wiglaf, son of Weohstan, spoke, sad at heart, looking at those hated men:

"Indeed, he who wishes to utter the truth may say that the lord who gave you those treasures, that war-gear in which you stand there - when on the ale-bench he often bestowed on those sitting in hall, a prince to his thanes, the finest battle-garments he could find near or far - utterly and wretchedly wasted that war-clothing. Not at all did the folk-king need to boast of his comrades in arms when battle overtook him! Yet God granted him, the Wielder of Victory, that he alone avenged himself with his blade when he needed strength. Little protection could I give him in battle, and yet I attempted beyond my measure to help my kinsman.

The deadly foe was ever the weaker while I hewed him with my sword, the fire surged less strongly from his head. Too few defenders thronged around the prince when the dread moment came to him. Now the receiving of treasure and the giving of swords, all joys of home and comfort must fail for your kin - every man of your family must go stripped of his land-right when nobles from afar learn of your flight, your dishonorable deed. Death is better for any earl than a life of shame!"

Then he commanded the outcome of that fight be announced at the stronghold up over the sea-cliffs where that troop of earls had sat, sorrowful in spirit, the livelong day, bearing their shields, both expecting his return and dreading it, the man they loved. Little did he keep silent of the new tidings who rode to the headland, but truthfully spoke before them all:

"Now the lord of the Weder-Geats, the giver of treasure to men, lies dead on his death-bed, fallen from wounds given by the dragon. Beside him lies the bane of his life, dead from knife-wounds - the serpent could not vanquish him with its sword.

Wiglaf, son of Weohstan, sits over Beowulf, one warrior over the other who has fallen, reverently keeping watch over the dead man. Now the people may expect a time of war as soon as the fall of the king becomes openly known far and wide to the Franks and the Frisians. The feud with the Hugas was brought about savagely after Hygelac came sailing with his fleet into Frisian lands, where the Hetware humbled him in battle, bravely attained an overwhelming victory with their greater host so that the mailed warrior was forced to bow - he fell among his troops. The prince gave no spoils to his retainers.

To us ever since that time the favor of the Merovingian king has been denied. Nor do I expect any peace or loyalty at all from the Swedish people, for it was widely known that Ongentheow took the life of Hæthcyn, son of Hrethel, by Ravenswood when, out of pride, the Geats first sought war with the warlike Scylfings.

Soon the aged father of Ohthere, old and terrible, gave him back his blow, destroyed the sea-king, rescued his wife, the old woman, bereft of gold, mother of Onela and Ohthere, and then pursued his deadly foes until they escaped, deprived of their lord, with great difficulty into Ravenswood. Then with a huge army he besieged those whom the sword had left, weary from their wounds. Often he threatened woe to the wretched company the whole night through - he said that in the morning he would end their miseries with the sword's edges, hang some upon the gallows-tree as a sport for birds.

Relief came again to the downhearted men together with daylight when they heard Hygelac's horn, his trumpet sounding as that worthy warrior came tracking their trail with his strong company.

The bloody swathe of Swedes and Geats, the deadly rush of men, was widely seen, how those folk aroused feud between them! Then the good one, the old and terrible king, retreated with his kinsmen, seeking higher ground. He had heard of Hygelac's prowess, the proud one's war-craft. He did not believe he could resist the seamen, the ocean-travelers, defend his hoard, his children and wife against those battle-braves. From there the old king retreated behind the earth-wall.

Then chase was given to the Swedish people, their banners were overrun. Forth they hastened over that place of refuge, Hrethel's descendents charged into that fortress. Then was Ongentheow, the white-haired king, driven to bay with the edges of swords, so that the mighty leader was forced to submit to Eofor's sole judgment.

Wulf Wonreding reached him angrily with his weapon so that blood sprang from his head for that blow in streams. Yet the aged Scylfing was not daunted - he repaid that deadly stroke with a worse exchange as soon as the people's king turned towards him. Nor could the swift son of Wonred deal an answering blow to the old man, for Ongentheow had first cleft through his helmet on his head so he was spattered with blood, collapsing on the ground. Yet he was not doomed then - he recovered himself, though the wound touched him sorely.

Then the hardy thane of Hygelac let his broad blade, his old giant-sword, break through the giant shield when his brother lay prostrate. The helm was shattered - the king, shepherd of the people, was struck down, his life cut short. Then there were many who bound up his brother's wounds, quickly raised him up when the place was cleared for them so they could command the battlefield. Meanwhile one warrior stripped the other - Eofor took from Ongentheow his iron byrnie, his hard, hilted sword and his helmet too, bearing the graith of that gray-beard to Hygelac.

He received those trappings and fairly promised rewards among the people - and he performed it! Hygelac, lord of the Geats, when he returned home, repaid Eofor and Wulf for their battle-onrush with exceedingly rich treasures - he gave each of them a hundred thousand in land and linked rings, nor had any man on middle-earth cause to condemn those rewards since they had won fame by fighting!

And then Hygelac bestowed on Eofor his only daughter, an honor to his home, a pledge of loyalty. That is the feud, the enmity, the deadly hatred of men for which I expect the Swedish people to seek us out after they learn our lord is lifeless, he who upheld our treasure and our realm against our enemies, wrought good for his people, and furthermore did deeds of valor.

Now we had best hurry to gaze upon our folk-king and bring his body, who gave us rings, to the funeral pyre. No mere part of it shall melt with the bold man, but there is a hoard of treasures, uncounted gold grimly purchased, and now at last rings bought with his own life. These the fire shall devour, flames shall bury - no earl shall wear any treasure as a memorial, nor any fair maiden have a ring-ornament around her neck, but shall tread bereft of gold, often and not once, an exile in a foreign land now that the leader of our host has laid aside laughter, merriment and glee. Thus many a cold morning shall the spear be grasped in frozen fingers, hefted by hands, nor shall the sound of the harp rouse warriors, but the raven, glad over the fallen, shall speak a great deal, telling the eagle how he fared at his feast when he plundered the slain with the wolf."

So that brave warrior was relating the unwelcome news. He did not much speak falsely of facts or words. The troop all arose, went sadly under the Eagle's Cliff with welling tears to gaze upon the curious sight. They found him then, who had given them treasure in times past, lifeless on the sand, their lord passed away. The last day had come upon that worthy man, for the king in battle, the prince of the Weders, died a wondrous death.

But first they beheld there a stranger being, that loathsome beast on the ground there, the hateful dragon lying opposite. The fire-drake was grisly and scorched by flames, measuring fifty feet where he lay. Once he delighted to fly through the air at night, then down again to his den. Now he was fast in death, having had his fill of earthen caverns. Beside him stood goblets and bowls, platters and precious swords, rusty and eaten through as if they had remained a thousand winters in the earth's embrace. That mighty heritage, gold of the ancients, was enchanted so that no man could touch the ring-hall, unless God Himself, True King of Victories, gave to whom He wished to open the hoard - even to that man as seemed fitting to Him.

Then it was clear that the way did not prosper for he who wrongly hid riches under the mound. The guardian slew some few and the feud was dreadfully avenged. It is a wonder for any hero of valor to reach the end of his life-span when he can no longer dwell, though long he may, within the mead-hall among his kinsmen.

Such was Beowulf's fate when he sought the barrow's warden, its hidden menace - he was not fully aware how his parting from the world would happen. The mighty princes who put that treasure there pronounced fearful curses till doomsday so that the man who invaded that ground would be guilty of sins, confined in pagan temples, fast in the bonds of hell, punished by plagues. He was not gold-greedy - he sought that hoard more by necessity, for his master's sake, than by his own choice!

"Often must an individual suffer misery for the will of one, as has happened to us. We could not persuade our beloved lord, shepherd of the kingdom, by any means not to attack the gold-guardian, let him lie where he long had been, dwell in his haunts until the end of the world. He held to his high destiny. That hoard is grimly won, that fate overpowering which drew the king thither. I was within and saw it all, the precious treasures of that cave, as it was granted to me - no pleasant journey was it for me under the earthen wall! I quickly grasped a huge and mighty burden of precious treasures and bore it out to my king. He was still alive then, wise and witting. Many things he spoke, the aged man in his anguish, and bade me greet you, commanded you be told to build, in memory of your prince's deeds, a great and famous barrow on the pyre-site, a mighty memorial, for he was the worthiest man in the wide world through the long days of his life, while he could still enjoy his wealth.

Let us hasten now a second time to see and seek that heap of rare gems, that wonder under the wall! I will guide you so you may gaze upon those ample rings and broad gold. Let the bier be made ready, quickly prepared, when we come out, and then let us bear our master, our beloved man, to where he shall wait long in the Almighty's keeping."

Then the son of Weohstan ordered his brave warriors that they command the lords of dwellings, many men, to bear firewood from afar for the pyre to where their good lord lay:

"Now shall fire consume, the wan flame tower over the mighty one who often endured the iron-tipped arrows when the storm of bowstrings drove them forth, sped over the shield-wall - the shaft did its duty, urged on by its feather-fittings, obeying the barb!"

Now the wise son of Weohstan summoned together from the king's band of thanes the seven best ones, and as the eighth went himself with them under the cursed roof. One of the warriors who went in front bore in his hand a flaming torch. It was not left up to lots to determine who should plunder that hoard when the warriors partly saw it sitting undefended, lying there lost. Little did any man mourn having to shake out those treasures speedily when they bore the dear treasures out, the dragon also, over the sea-cliff, letting the waves take that guardian of jewels, the flood embrace him.

There was twisted gold loaded on a wagon, countless treasures, and the prince, their gray-haired battle-king, the best of men, was carried to Hronesness.

For him then the people of the Geats prepared a pyre on the earth, no small one, hung round with helmets, battle-shields, bright byrnies, as he had requested. In the midst of it they laid their great prince, lamenting their beloved lord. Then warriors began to kindle the greatest of funeral fires on the mound. Wood-smoke rose up black above the blaze, the roaring flame mingled with weeping - the tumult of the winds lay still - till it had broken the bone-house, hot in the heart. Sad in mind, sorrowful in spirit, they mourned their liege lord's death. Likewise a Geatish woman with bound tresses sang a sorrowful song of Beowulf, earnestly declaring again and again that she sorely dreaded evil days for herself, much bloodshed, horror of battle, shame and captivity.

Heaven swallowed the smoke.

Then the people of the Weders made a mound on the cliff, which was high and broad, to be seen far and wide by wave-farers. And they built a beacon, the battle-brave's memorial, in ten days. They surrounded the ashes of the pyre with a wall in a way most worthy for men of wisdom to contrive. In that barrow they placed rings and jewels, all such trappings as brave-minded men had before taken from the hoard. They let the earth hold that ancestral treasure, gold in the dust, as useless to men now as it was before.

Then brave battle-warriors rode their horses around the mound, children of nobles, twelve in all. They wished to bewail their sorrow and mourn their king, recite their dirges and speak of the man. They praised his heroism and appraised his great deeds, deeming it fitting that men should extol their lord in words and cherish him in their hearts when he must be led forth from his bodily home.

So the Geatish people, his hearth-companions, mourned the passing of their lord. They said that he was of all the kings in the world, the mildest of men and the gentlest, kindest to his people, and the most eager for fame.
