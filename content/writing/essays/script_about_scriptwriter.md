**STATUS: DRAFT**

> "Bad books on writing and thoughtless English professors solemnly tell beginners to Write What You Know, which explains why so many mediocre novels are about English professors contemplating adultery." -- Joe Haldeman

I believe there is an inherent lazyness to people writing about their own profession
book, scriptwriter, mangaka, moviemaker

i understand the attraction, thus they can speak from experience and introduce some additoinal realism
and maybe the illusion that it is a true story (link fargo)

obviously there are exeption, scott mccloud made a comic about making comics
but it is *not* a comic about a comic writer, it is a comic about the theory and thinking that goes into making a comic
a treaty on the subject

but i believe it is lazy in that they choose something easy rather than the profession that would best fit their story
one might argue that i don't know those stories as well as their author and that it might ve the perfect profession!
but given the number of overwhelming number of scriptwriters in movis, I have a strong, statistically guided, suspicion that there are not that many story for which the best main protagonist's job would be script writer...
