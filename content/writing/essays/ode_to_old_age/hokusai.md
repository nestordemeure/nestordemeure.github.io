[Hokusai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hokusai) is considered one of the greatest masters in the history of art.
Even if you do not know his name, you *have* seen a reproduction or a take on his [Great Wave off Kanagawa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Great_Wave_off_Kanagawa2.jpg).

In his seventies, shortly after making *the Great Wave off Kanagawa*, he wrote:

> *"From the age of six, I had a passion for copying the form of things and since the age of fifty I have published many drawings, yet of all I drew by my seventieth year there is nothing worth taking into account.*
> 
> *At seventy-three years I partly understood the structure of animals, birds, insects and fishes, and the life of grasses and plants.*
>
> *And so, at eighty-six I shall progress further; at ninety I shall even further penetrate their secret meaning, and by one hundred I shall perhaps truly have reached the level of the marvellous and divine.*
>
> *When I am one hundred and ten, each dot, each line will possess a life of its own."*

He continued to paint until his death, at age 88, at which point he is rumored to have said:

> *"If only Heaven will give me just another ten years ... Just another five more years, then I could become a real painter"*
