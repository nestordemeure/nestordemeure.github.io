> *"It is a tale Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, Signifying nothing."*
-- [William Shakespeare, Macbeth, 5.5](https://youtu.be/HZnaXDRwu84)

A series of recent discussions made me realize that people believe in movies a lot more than I thought and a lot more than they should.

Let's be clear, all forms of depictions are lies, [the map is not the territory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map%E2%80%93territory_relation) and [this is not a pipe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Treachery_of_Images).
But, I believe that movies have a stronger power of letting us think that they are a reality and remember them as genuine memory: there is a reason [people started dreaming in black and white when cinema was in black and white](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1053810008001323?via%3Dihub).

So, movie lies matter but, how do they lie?

## Documentaries

Let's start with the kind of movies for which the line between reality and fiction is best defined: documentaries.
there is an implicit contract between the audience and the documentary: the event depicted are real.

However, even when you are pointing a camera at a real event, your point of focus is a decision, it shapes a *narrative*.
The choice of focal and point of view can make a street feel crowded or empty, filming violence can turn a protest into a riot while filming people sitting down turns a riot into a peaceful manifestation.

whenever there is a code in cinema, there is a director to play with it.
In the case of documentary, it was Orson Welles with is great [F for Fake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F_for_Fake), a serie of improbable stories that start with Welles swearing that everything will be true in the next hour of the movie.
However, the movie lasts more than an hour and the last story is fully fabricated!
This is a magician's lie, in our face, explicit yet deceptive. But, lies can be more subtile.

Even the things we are shown and told do not need to be real.
Documentaries have been known to recreate pictures to fill holes in their narrative and a recent documentary on Anthony Bourdain [caused a small scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roadrunner:_A_Film_About_Anthony_Bourdain#Controversy_over_use_of_artificial_intelligence) when it was revealed that part of the voiceover, by Bourdain himself, had been generated by an artifical inteligence (something he might not have liked given his interest in the authentic).

## Based on a true stories

Movies *"Based on a true"* are more insidious in that the audience accepts that they are a fictionalized depiction of real events.

That means that the movie can hardly be critized for its modifications while the audience will accept and remember the event they saw *as real*.
You might doubt it but asking around you should reveal that, while people believe most dialogues to have been made up by the screenwriter, they do believe that the event pictured happened and that the background information is real (how many people, after having seen [Hidden Figures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Figures#Historical_accuracy) will believe that NASA had segregated bathrooms in the 60s).

The Cohen brothers played with this expectation in their movie [Fargo](https://creepycatalog.com/true-story-movie-fargo/).
The movie starts with a screen telling us that it is based on a true storie but that the names have been changed.
Then, a crazy story unfolds.

There is no true story behind the movie. It is entirely made up by the Cohen brothers.
Revealing this caused a small controversy, "you can't do that!" to which they answered "why not?".
And indeed, by some standards any crime in the vague geographical area of the movie's background and with a barely matching description would have been enough to declare it based on a true story.

There is [no standard of accuracy](https://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/based-on-a-true-true-story/) for movies based on a true story.

## Fiction

Happily enough, some movies are fiction. They might happen in our world or during a known historical period but the director makes no claim of accuracy and lets us know p front that the story is purely fictional.

even when people will tell you that they know the story as been modified to make it more cinematographic
they still take the background information for a given (racism at nasa rom hidden figures)
even in a fiction (movie saw with maruf), people accept that they are watching a fiction but if the realisator tells us that the fiction is set in our world then the parts of our world it depicts ten to sip into our subconscious model of the world

tarantino tell that to us in inglorious basterds
i remember the chock at the times
people being outraged that he modified history
while is point is that it is a movie, not history, there is no contract
he does not follow the implicit contract in the mind of the audience
to help us realise that no one does

## Why?

why do they lie

most of the time it is just because it make for a better story
better antagonism, a more practical world, better rythm

sometimes by accident, because something sipped into the subconscious mind of the production team

sometimes because they want to play with us
f for fake and fargo are in that category

sometime because they want to convince us of something
nationalism for example
those are dangerous

my main point is that movies lie
all of them
always
and that is okay
but you should konw the difference between truth and lies and try to understand when you are ied to
because some lies are not innocent and you should not update your knowledge of the world from lies
knowing why can be important sometimes, enjoyable others
