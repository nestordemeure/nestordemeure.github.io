[J. R. R. Tolkien](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._R._R._Tolkien) was born in January 1892. Oxford professor and indisputed father of modern fantasy, *he published a total of 3 novels*[^def] *in his life*.

[^def]: Note that we are only talking about fiction novels. [He did also publish some academic work, as well as poetry and short stories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._R._R._Tolkien_bibliography).

Tolkien had only published some poetry and academic works when he published [The Hobbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hobbit), then aged 45. He would later publish the three volumes of his magnum opus, [The Lord of the Rings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings), between the ages of 62 and 63.

He did *not publish much*, and he *did not publish early*.
