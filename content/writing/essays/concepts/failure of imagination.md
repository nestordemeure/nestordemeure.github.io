A [failure of imagination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failure_of_imagination) is usually a bad outcome that, despite being predictable, is not imagined and thus not planned for.
I however use the expression in a positive light, to speak of a good outcome that, despite being possible, is not imagined and thus not explored.
I know of two failures of imagination:

The first failure of imagination is *imagining that something is impossible* unless proven otherwise. And even then, one should be attentive to the hypotheses that went into the proof as well as what exactly has been proven impossible[^impossible].

The second failure of imagination is *doing things the way everyone else does*. Because one does not even realize that there is another way. 

[^impossible]: I learned how to prove that something is not possible using math. Then engineering taught me that something being impossible usually just meant that I needed to consider a larger set of tools or a finer definition of the problem I want solved. Most things are possible up to an acceptable threshold.
