> *"It is a tale Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, Signifying nothing."*
-- [William Shakespeare, Macbeth, 5.5](https://youtu.be/HZnaXDRwu84)

Movies are not reality.
It might sound obvious but, a series of recent discussions made me realize that, while people *consciously* know that movies are not an accurate depiction of reality, there is still an implicit expectation of faithfulness to reality.

What do I mean?

1 the human brain is bad at telling film from reality
2 movies are not reality (and some directors play with it)
3 if we are not in control then others are

## Fiction

No one expects fiction to depict reality faithfully, it is fiction.

However, when Quentin Tarantino depicted a US commando killing Hitler in his movie [Inglourious Basterds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inglourious_Basterds), people reacted *viscerally*: you cannot do that, it feels wrong!

By twisting history in a way so big that no one can miss it, [Tarantino is reminding us that fiction has no obligation to be faithful to history](https://youtu.be/vUyWruE-eRg).
We *expect* our fiction to be accurate if it happens in a known time period but, directors have no such obligations.

Paradoxically, our expectations can even force a movie to stray further from reality.
For example, we now have a mental picture of the Far West that has been shaped by a hundred years of cinema and is [quite different](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/55uvfk/how_accurate_is_hollywoods_portrayal_of_what_we/) from the actual time period (most cowboys were... workers heading cows).

This is not limited to far-away time periods.
A friend *learned* from [Taken](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taken_(film)) (building on existing ground, mostly seeded by other movies) that there is a very real risk of being sex trafficked by east Europeans if you are a woman visiting Europe for tourism[^sex].

Even if we know that movie events are fictional, their background sips into our subconscious model of the world.
This is *very* powerful and *is* being used to shape our view of the world[^dod].

[^sex]: In short, no. [Taken is not an accurate depiction of sex trafficking](http://www.courtneyshouse.org/our-blog/taken-3-fact-vs-fiction) and a young woman traveling in Europe would most likely be fine.
If you want to learn more about this subject, I recommend that you check this link of facts and fiction on human trafficking (it is not a happy read but, it is instructive): https://polarisproject.org/myths-facts-and-statistics/.

[^dod]: There is a reason [the US Department of Defence has strong contacts with Hollywood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military-entertainment_complex) (it *sounds* like a conspiracy theory if you are not aware of it but, do look into it, [Nazis were not the only ones to be big on cinema](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism_and_cinema)).

## Based on a true story

Biopics, historical movies, and movies *"Based on a true story"* have an interesting relation with reality in that the audience accepts that they are a fictionalized depiction of real events.

That means that the movie can hardly be criticized for its modifications (it is fictionalized) while the audience will accept and remember the event they saw *as real*.
While people believe most dialogues have been made up by the screenwriter, the *events* pictured and background details[^background] are being remembered as historical facts (how many people, after having seen [Hidden Figures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Figures#Historical_accuracy), will believe that [NASA had segregated bathrooms and a segregated unit in the 60s](https://www.cnet.com/culture/hidden-figures-nasa-true-stories-octavia-spencer-janelle-monae-taraji-henson-kevin-costner/)).

The Cohen brothers masterfully played with the idea of a true story in their movie [Fargo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fargo_(1996_film)).
The movie starts with a screen telling us that it is based on a true story, only the names have been changed out of respect for the dead.
Ensues a crazy story in the middle of nowhere.

Some movies tell you that they are [based on a true story](https://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/based-on-a-true-true-story/) but don't care for the truth ([there was a person killed nearby at a similar point in time, good enough](https://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/13-based-on-true-story-movies-that-are-totally-inaccurate.htm)), it is mostly a sales pitch.
In the case of Fargo, [there is no true story behind the movie](https://creepycatalog.com/true-story-movie-fargo/).
How does having that information, that was not given to moviegoers, alter our watching experience? Does it diminishes or increases our enjoyment?
Is it *unfair*?
Would the movie be better if they did start from a barely related newspaper clipping?

[^background]: I believe that this is a key distinction.
The foreground events capture the attention and the critical thinking of the audience while the background is being watched and remembered with significantly less scrutiny.
Five movies later, a piece of background information is taken as a fact about a time or group of people.

## Documentaries

Documentaries are about facts and thus, cannot lie or deform reality.

But, can we tell the difference between a documentary and a fiction?
There are [several movie genres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudo-documentary#See_also) dedicated to imitating documentaries with various degrees of realism.

Can we tell the difference between fact and fiction?
A recent documentary on Anthony Bourdain [caused a small scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roadrunner:_A_Film_About_Anthony_Bourdain#Controversy_over_use_of_artificial_intelligence) when it was revealed that parts of the voiceover, by Bourdain himself, had been generated by an artificial intelligence after Bourdain's death and without any permission from Bourdain's estate.
One cannot tell the difference between the genuine voice of Anthony Bourdain and the additions.

Can we tell the difference between what is being *shown* and what happened?
Filming violence can turn a protest into a riot.
Filming people sitting down can turn a riot into a peaceful manifestation.

When someone points a camera at an event, even a real event, the point of focus is a decision.
It shapes a *narrative*.
Documentaries are *not* objective records: they are movies that have something to say about our reality.

## Does it matter?

Let's be clear, all depictions are inherently different from the object depicted, [the map is not the territory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map%E2%80%93territory_relation) and [this is not a pipe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Treachery_of_Images).

But, I believe that movies have a strong power of letting us think that they depict reality and be remembered as a genuine memory[^bw].
When you think of a historical figure after having seen a biopic about that person, your thoughts go to the figure and life depicted in the biopic, not to the actual historical human being that you never met and barely read about.
This is why the relationship between movies and the real matters.

Most of the time, movies twist reality because it makes for a better story (better antagonists, a more practical world, better rhythm maybe).
Sometimes they do it by accident, the production team just happened to believe something (maybe because they saw it in a movie).
Sometimes they are toying with us, they want us to have the [sudden realization that we are listening to a liar](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072962/).
And sometimes they want to convince us of something which might be [good](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Figures) or [not](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism_and_cinema).

Not all movies are tales told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.
Some have meanings and goals, if you don't think about the difference between truth and fiction in the movies you watch, then you let others shape your reality.

[^bw]: There is a reason [people dreamed in black and white when cinema was in black and white](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1053810008001323?via%3Dihub).
