Both fairy tales (rumpelstinsskin), some religions (judaism) and magickal thinking (law of ???) tell us that knowing the name of something gives us power over it.
I believe there is a very important kernel of truth to it.

As the greeks discovered when they named ideas (???), naming something suddenly gives you the power to think about it, twist it, use it in novel ways and reuse it.
It suddenly becomes a concept you can take into account consciously.

This list is dedicated to such concepts, ideas that once named and put into words have changed my thinking in small ways.
I am convinced that there are concepts that have changed my thinking in radical way but I suspect that such ground breaking changes are so large that I, paradoxically, [don't notice them consciously](https://youtu.be/PhhC_N6Bm_s?t=18).
