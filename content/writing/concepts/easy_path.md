The opposite of wanting something to be perfect is following **the easy path**: knowing that some things could be done to make your project objectively better but keeping the current version because it is *"good enough"*.

This, *as long as the modification would be within scope and allotted time*[^1], is a form of laziness.
However, it is insidious, all parts of a project have to be considered *"good enough"* before you let go of them to tackle the next step, it is very easy to not realize that your motivation shifted from an objective look at the quality of your work toward avoiding additional work to the detriment of the end result.

Knowing that *the easy path* exists helps a lot to recognize when it happens and turn an unconscious process into conscious one where you can weight the pro and con of the decision properly.
However, the most efficient way to fight *the easy path* is to have other people take a look at your work and give you constructive feedback.
As they do not have to work to implement the modifications they are suggesting, they will be naturally immune to the easy path.
You might still try and resist tooth and nails but, now that you know what *the easy path* is, you can distinguish between laziness and justified cuts.

[^1]: That nuance matters. Some modifications would improve a project but are just too time-consuming to be practical.
