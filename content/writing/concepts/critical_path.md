**STATUS: DRAFT**

The [critical path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_path_method) is
definition

how to apply it?
when several people do something obviously
but i extend it to a single person: sometimes you have a lot of tasks to do and a rough approximation of the time needed to do them, tasks on the critical path should be done in prioriy

why it matters?
