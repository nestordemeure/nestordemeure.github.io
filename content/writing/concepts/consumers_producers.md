Most activities can be categorized as either **consumer** or **producer**.

A *consumer* activity is an activity during which you consume existing content such as watching a video, reading a book, or browsing the Internet.
Depending on the content you consumed, it can be nourishing or leave you with a feeling of emptiness.

A *producer* activity is an activity during which you produce new content for others to consume such as drawing, writing, cooking, or programming.
It is creative and gives you a feeling of accomplishment but requires time, focus, and practice.

Having those two labels lets you see how much time you delegate to each type of activity and spot unbalances[^1].
You can now *consciously* push toward your preferred ratio of consuming and producing.

[^1]: You are likely to realize that you do mostly consumer activities.
It is perfectly okay and normal: consumer activities are *necessary*, you cannot produce if you are not nourished by the things you have consumed and they soothe you after a day of work or focus.
