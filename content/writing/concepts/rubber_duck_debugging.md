**STATUS: DRAFT**

One good tip I got to rubber duck debug without another human was to write your questions / explanations in an email or a chat.
I found that indeed, writing an email explaining a problem to a colleague was helpful to solve it despite me never sending the email.

It also applies to debugging the human mind.

I knew a [mentalist](/about/mentalism) who would Rubber debug with famous dead people.
