> *"Writing is easy. Just put a sheet of paper in the typewriter and start bleeding."*
â€” [Walter Wellesley "Red" Smith](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2011/09/14/writing-bleed/)


*I am the intended reader of this guide. If the tone seems harsh or the advice opinionated, it is because I can sometimes be harsh with myself and because I *know* that those techniques work for me. I have written non-fiction professionally in various fields but never published any fiction so take the following with the appropriate amount of salt.*

## Do a bad version first

Stealing advice from [Dan Harmon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Harmon), *start by writing something bad*.

The human mind is terrible at writing something perfect in one go but very good at criticizing things.
So, instead of getting stuck on trying to write a good first draft, let's accept that it will be bad and push forward until we have written all the things that need to be written.
Then, you can improve it progressively to make it good.

That frees you from writer's block (just write, never mind that it is bad) and shows you the proper way to produce something good: iterating on it.

## Make it look good fast

Finally, and this is not always possible, I found that making my draft look as close as possible to the final result is highly motivating.
This can sometimes be done by having a tool to export your draft as a formatted PDF (such as [LaTeX](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes) via [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/)), [HTML](/writing/guides/blogging), etc.

While purely a matter of perspective, it puts you in the right state of mind to finish the project. It helps you see your project as a *finished product with holes to be filled* rather than as an idea quickly thrown on paper.

## Give yourself time

When you work on a piece of text, your mind gets used to it and its quirks. You lose the ability to judge it objectively.

My solution is to do a few passes on the text then, once it stops evolving, *wait*.
Give myself a handful of days away from the text, both writing *and reading*, before going back to it.
I then do further passes until it stops evolving once more and repeat the cycle as many times as necessary, with longer and longer breaks[^time], until the text convergences.

[^time]: I even read about a writer who had to set a draft aside for a year due to family reasons and highly recommended the experience.
She explained that it freed her completely from any attachment to the text, letting her focus on the quality of the book.

## Make a plan full of holes

I am a planner. 
Some people think they are not planners, I believe that it is a skill acquired by practice (and, thus, you will start by being bad at it which might lead you to give up before getting good at it) but, I am a polite person and I shut up.

Being a planner, I believe that you should start with a plan[^1].
Then, for all sections of your plan, you make a plan.
Repeating the process until you have a clear idea of what you are going to say in each unit of text (which could be somewhere between a chapter and a paragraph)[^2].

Once you know what to say[^3], you should be able to write a bad version of it fairly easily.
And once you have a bad version of everything, *you have a first draft!*
You can now iterate on it until it becomes good.

[^1]: Once you have an idea, you can even use a ready-made plan.
For fiction, [the Hero's journey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero%27s_journey) is *the* classic on the subject.
[Save the cat](https://savethecat.com/) might be its best know incarnation amongst screenwriters but, I am partial to Dan Harmon's version: [the story circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Harmon#%22Story_circle%22_technique). Mostly because it feels detailed enough to give me a frame while being high-level enough to not feel formulaic.

[^2]: This shares some similarities with [the snowflake method](https://www.advancedfictionwriting.com/articles/snowflake-method/).

[^3]: I like to highlight that part of the text in yellow, it makes it easy to find and replace later.

## Listen to your editors

If you *respect* the opinions of one of your readers then they become an editor (informal and unpaid).

Editors are precious, they have an outside perspective that let them see weaknesses in your text that you cannot see due to being submerged in it (structural problems, lack of information given to the reader, terrible spelling, etc.).
Furthermore, they do not have to work to correct the shortcomings they notice so laziness does not stop them from aiming for perfection (they are naturally immune to [the easy path](/writing/concepts/easy_path)).

However, you are a human being and your text is your precious baby.
You *will be* tempted to fight them and tell them that none of the things they suggest would be an improvement, they are just picky!
My suggestion to you would be to make a copy of your work and *try their suggestions*. 
You have nothing to lose, and they are likely right (after all, you respect their opinion for a reason).

There is a risk of losing your vision, letting it be diluted by different positions, but it is part of your job to have a clear vision.
You have to know what you want, everything else can be improved on with patience and enough work.

## In conclusion

Start writing, keep writing, come back to your writing and you will be rewarded[^also].

[^also]: A lot of this advice is shared with my [guide to doing a large project](/writing/guides/hard_things). I highly recommend that you consult it.
