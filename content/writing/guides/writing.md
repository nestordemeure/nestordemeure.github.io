**STATUS: DRAFT**

**Disclaimer:** I have written non-fiction professionally in various fields by never published any fiction so take the following with the appropriate amount of salt.
Also, a lot of this advice is shared with my [guide to doing a large project](/writing/guides/hard_things). I highly recommend that you consult it.

## Make it look good fast

This does not apply to all texts but I found that, when possible, making my draft look as close as possible to the final result is highly motivating.
This can sometimes be done by having a tool to export your draft as a formatted PDF ([LaTeX](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes) and [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) are great for that), HTML, etc.

The key idea is that it helps you see your project *as a finished product* with holes to be filled rather than as a never-ending draft.
While purely a matter of perspective, it puts you in the right state of mind to finish the project rather than leave it beautiful but unfinished.

## Do a bad version first

There is always a block to overcome at the very beginning of a project.

Stealing advice from [Dan Harmon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Harmon), I would recommend that you start by making a *bad* version.
Knowing that your first draft *will be bad* frees you from the urge to try and make it perfect, you can just focus on writing all the things that needs to be written.

The trick is that, while the human mind is bad at producing a perfect text in one go, it is quite good at taking something and giving constructive criticism.
Once you have written your first draft, you can come back to it and improve on it iteratively until you see no more defects.

## Give yourself time

When you work on a piece of text, your mind gets used to it and its quirks. You lose the ability to judge it objectively.

My solution is to do a few passes on the text then, once it stops evolving, wait.
Give myself days away from the text, both writing *and reading*, before going back to it.

Once the text stops evolving, you repeat the circle with a longer break.
Doing it as many times as necessary to reach convergence.

## Make a plan full of holes

(this is, in essence, [the snowflake method](https://www.advancedfictionwriting.com/articles/snowflake-method/))

## Listen to your editors

If you *respect* the opinion of one of your readers then it becomes an (informal and unpaid) editor.

Editors are precious, they have an outside perspective that let them see weakness (structural problems, lack of information given to the reader, terrible spelling, etc.) in your text that you cannot see due to being submerged in it.
Furthermore, they do not have to work to correct the shortcomings they see so they are not too lazy to give you advice to aim for perfection (they are naturally immune to [the easy path](/writing/concepts/easy_path)).

However, you are a human being and your text is your precious baby.
You *will be* tempted to fight them and tell them that none of the things they suggest would be an improvement, they are just picky!
My suggestion to you would be to make a copy of your work and try their suggestions. That way you have nothing to lose (after all you want to refuse their suggestion for rational reasons, trying both way cost only a bit of time and will stretch your writing muscles anyway).
You will not be surprised to discover that your respect their opinion (except for that particular suggestion) for a reason and that most of the time they are right.

There is only one risk to this, losing your vision.
You are the only one knowing what you are going for and letting too many people push you in different directions might dilute that vision.
But it is your job to be clear on what you want and apply their recommendation while not letting that happen.
