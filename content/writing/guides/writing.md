**STATUS: DRAFT**

**Disclaimer:** I have written non-fiction professionally in various fields by never published any fiction so take the following with the appropriate amount of salt.

do a bad version first

identify lazyness
things you could improve to make the result better
but do not improve because you think it is good enough
even if you know it would make it better

story circle

snowflake method

make it *look* good fast
