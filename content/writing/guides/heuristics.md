Here are some heuristics I use in life and work:

- Play to your strengths; being balanced sounds nice but ends up being really unproductive/unpleasant.
- Spend time on the things you like, as time and practice pile up you will end up skilled in those domains.
- Go for the things that are of interest to you, not for the trendy ones.
- Time spent automating tasks is usually time well spent.
- Taking a break to gather knowledge on something vaguely connected to the thing you are doing is never time lost.
- When you have been procrastinating something for most of the day, declare that you will not do it today and that it is okay; it will free your mind to do other things instead of leaving you stuck.
- Try and do one, single and quantifiable, thing a day. With time, they pile up, and you end up doing a lot of things.
- The mind is good at criticizing something but bad at doing something from scratch: instead of trying to produce perfection, do a rough draft and then improve on it incrementally.
- Also, be nice, kind, and nonjudgmental to people.
