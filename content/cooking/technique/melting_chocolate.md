The classical technique to melt chocolate is to use a *double broiler* (also called bain Marie).
However, I am deeply convinced that using a microwave is significantly easier and faster.

## Ingredients:

* chocolate to melt
* a tablespoon of water (you need some water to prevent dry burning but too much will deteriorate the end result)
* if the recipe calls for melted butter, adding cream or milk, you can replace the water with one of those in the quantities required by the recipe

## Technique:

* put the chocolate in a small bowl
* add the liquid or milk produce
* microwave until the chocolate is softened (around one minute depending on the strength of your microwave)
* mix the result to finish melting the chocolate

## Credits:

I am not aware of any particular credit for this technique, I saw it in a variety of sources.
