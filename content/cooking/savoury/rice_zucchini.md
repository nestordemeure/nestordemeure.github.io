This dish is all about the pleasure of eating rice with Parmesan and butter, with some zucchini tossed in for good measure.
It is quick to do and delicious, try it on a weekday.

## Ingredients (one person):

* Half a zucchini,
* 60 grams of rice,
* a lot of salted butter[^1],
* as much Parmesan as butter,
* optionally, some smoked chilly flakes for added flavor complexity.

[^1]: Slightly more than what feels reasonable to you.

## Preparation:

* Peel the Zucchini and dice it,
* bring water to a boil,
* add the rice and zucchini to the water and cook for ten minutes[^2],
* put the butter in the plate,
* add the (optional) chilly flakes,
* once the rice and zucchini are cooked, strain and pour on the butter
* add the Parmesan and mix.

[^2]: You could add the zucchini slightly earlier, you want it thoroughly cooked and melting on the tongue.

## Credits:

This dish started as an accidental reinvention of [Alfredo sauce](https://youtu.be/z4qBXKeLNEc), a classical Italian pasta sauce made with a lot of Parmesan and butter.
