The Krautburger is my favourite homemade burger at the moment.
It is vegetarian (but not vegan, it includes mayo and, harder to replace, cheese) and light while being tasteful due to the taste of the melted cheese and toasted bun.
I really like the freshness of the thick tomato slice hidden inside the burger.

## Ingredients

* burger bun
* mayo
* tomato
* saurkraut
* 2 cheese slice (pepper jak)

## Preparation

* spread mayo on each half bun
* put thick tomato slice on bottom until it is fully covered
* add one slice of cheese
* put equivalent of small pattie of sauerkraut on top
* add one more slice of cheese
* add final bun

## Cooking

* toast in oven until cheese is nicely melted

## Credits

This burger was born from some experimentation with leftovers.

The idea of using a thick slice of fresh tomato in a grilled sandwitch comes from the [bacon tomato melt](../bacontomatomelt).
