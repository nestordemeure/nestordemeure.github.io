Pizza is a classic for a reason. A lot of recipes call for preparing the dough on a previous day or a special oven, this recipe steers away from those best practices to give you something delicious within two hours.

## Ingredients (one pizza):

* 250 grams of flour
* 6 grams of salt
* 4 grams of dry yeast (about half a packet)
* 175 grams of warm water[^warm]
* 15 grams of olive oil (enough to coat the pan)

[^warm]: My rule of thumb is that it should feel warm, so above body temperature, but no more than that If you can burn your finger then it will kill your yeast.

## Preparation:

#### Dough

* mix the flour, salt and yeast in a big bowl
* add the water and mix into a sticky ball
* let rest covered for 15 minutes

* stretch and wrap back into a ball for about 5 minutes
* let rest covered for 30 minutes

* oil the bottom of your pan
* stretch the dough until it roughly fills the space (no need to be perfect yet)
* let rest for 20 minutes

* spread the dough to the edge of the pan (it should spread much easier now)

#### Toppings

* put your favorite toppings on the pizza, classics include tomato sauce (canned is fine but feel free to add spices and savor to it) and shredded mozzarella (you want dry one)[^detroit]

[^detroit]: One way to go would be to do a [Detroit style pizza](https://youtu.be/iY24pIHjT7s), starting with meat then a lot of cheese and finally a drizzle of tomato sauce.

#### Baking

* bake for about 20 minutes[^bake] in a 450F (230C) oven.

[^bake]: Until you reach the desired crispiness. Be careful not to go tosuggestiono far and have your cheese split into liquid fat.
