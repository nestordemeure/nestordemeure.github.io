Nachos are a great group meal to eat with friends. This particular version comes with a satisfying bean base to make it a proper meal that can be scooped with tortilla chips as you go.

## Ingredients (two servings):

* half of an onion (I like a red onion for decorative purposes)
* olive oil
* soy sauce
* one can of beans (I like chili beans)
* ketchup[^ketchup]
* cayenne pepper (you could use another source of spiciness such as chilly flakes)
* black pepper[^pepper]
* cumin
* paprika

* tortilla chips (I like the purple ones because of their color and because they are reliably good, no need for flavored ones)
* cheese slices (you want something that will taste satisfying once melted, I like mixed-color cheddar slices for their look)

[^ketchup]: Do not be afraid, here ketchup is a component of the sauce (bringing some tomato and sugar) and not the final flavor of the dish.

[^pepper]: Always grind your pepper as you need it, it is cheap and significantly tastier.

## Preparation:

#### Bean sauce

* dice the half onion finely and put it in a wok
* had the olive oil and soy sauce
* add the can of beans (you can drain the excess liquid but do keep most of it)
* add a generous amount of pepper, two pinches of cayenne pepper (careful not to put more, this is concentrated spiciness), cumin to taste and a very generous amount of paprika
* add a splash of ketchup
* cook until the sauce thickens significantly (you want all of your ingredients warm enough to eat as it except maybe the onions)

#### Toppings

* pour the sauce into the bottom of a glass or ceramic dish[^cook]
* cover with a generous amount of tortilla chips
* cover with a generous layer of cheese (I go with a one-slice thick amount)

[^cook]: You can precook the sauce for 5 to 10 minutes in a 350F (180C) oven. It will develop more flavor and give you a better result at the price of additional cooking time.

#### Baking

* put in an oven and bake until the cheese is melted to taste (the sauce is already cooked)

## Credits:

This recipe was inspired by [Adam Ragusea's nachos recipe](https://youtu.be/54bgnpePrIo?t=250) (mixed with my own tortilla recipe) which made me realize that I can and should cook nachos at home.
