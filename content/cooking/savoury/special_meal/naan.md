Naans are very easy to make, go well with any curry or thick sauce, and make for a nice change of carbs.

## Ingredients (3 big naans):

* 200 grams flour
* 1 teaspoon sugar
* a big pinch of salt
* 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
* 3 tablespoons of olive oil
* 125 grams yogurt
* 7 centiliters[^grams] of water

* 1 tablespoon butter (or ghee), 1 clove garlic and (optionally) cilantro for garlic naans
* laughing cow for cheese naans

[^grams]: 70 grams

## Preparation:

#### Dough

* mix the flour, sugar, salt, and baking powder
* add the olive oil and yogurt, mix
* add water progressively, stop before it becomes wet[^time]
* work the dough until it is smooth
* knead it into a ball[^oil], let rest under a wet towel for at least 2 hours at room temperature

[^time]: the exact amount of water to incorporate will vary depending on flour types.

[^oil]: You can oil it a bit to make it less sticky, especially when it will rest in the bowl.

#### Rolling

* knead the dough one last time
* break it into 3 small balls[^cheese]
* roll the balls into flat[^thick] circles

[^cheese]: For cheese naan, place one slice of laughing cow in the center of the ball so that it ends up trapped inside the naan.

[^thick]: Keep them about 3 millimeters thick. Too thin and they will not be able to rise much, too thick and they will end up doughy.

#### Cooking

* put in a warm skillet one at a time until they start inflating
* flip and wait two more minutes before setting aside
* for garlic naans, melt butter, add pressed garlic and diced cilantro then mix thoroughly before brushing on the cooked[^trad] naan

[^trad]: The butter would traditionally be brush on the naans before cooking, but I prefer it brushed afterward to preserve the brightest flavors.
