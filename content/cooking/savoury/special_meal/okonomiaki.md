Okonomiyaki, which roughly translates to "anything grilled," can be described as a Japanese cabbage and seafood-flavored pancake. But, that is very much off the mark as to what the dish is: think of a grilled disk of cabbage and batter, coated in a sweet sauce, and Japanese mayo. It is heaven and surprisingly easy to make.

## Ingredients (1 Okonomiyaki):

Batter:

* 76 grams flour
* 1/8 teaspoon[^pinch] of baking powder
* 1/4 teaspoon of salt
* 2 eggs
* 60 ml of warm water[^dashi]
* bonito flakes
* 1/2 teaspoon soy sauce
* 1/4 of a head of cabbage
* 1/4 of a red[^scallions] onion

[^pinch]: The technical term is a "pinch" but I am pretty sure that the dish would be fine if it were omitted.

[^dashi]: This will be used with soy sauce and bonito flakes to do a quick [dashi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashi) substitute. If you have dashi, use it.

[^scallions]: Green onions would be more traditional, but I like color and have red onions in my pantry.

Sauce[^sauce]:

* 1 tablespoon (26 grams) of ketchup
* 1 tablespoon (30 ml) of Worcestershire sauce
* 1/2 tablespoon (8 ml) of soy sauce
* 1/2 tablespoon (8 ml) of honey
* 1 teaspoon (4 grams) of molasses

[^sauce]: None of these ingredients are mandatory; there are many valid substitutions as long as you end up with a dark, sweet, and umami sauce.

Garnish:

* Japanese mayo
* bonito flakes
* nori flakes

## Preparation:

#### Dashi Substitute

* Get 60 ml of warm water.
* Add half a teaspoon of soy sauce.
* Add a generous amount of bonito flakes[^filter].
* Mix[^appetizing].

[^filter]: If we were making actual dashi, we would filter out the flakes after mixing thoroughly, but they will bring some fish elements to the final product.

[^appetizing]: The result will look and smell fishy, which might not be the most appetizing thing depending on your taste; this is fine as it will be incorporated in the batter, taking the place of dashi and diced seafood.

#### Batter

* Mix the flour, baking powder, and salt.
* Whisk the eggs then add them to the batter.
* Add your dashi substitute and mix.
* Dice[^onion] your cabbage and add it to the batter.
* Dice your onion and add it to the batter.
* Mix until everything is incorporated[^coleslaw].

[^onion]: Surprisingly, the onion cutting methods work great for cabbage...

[^coleslaw]: This will feel more like coleslaw than pancake batter; it is normal and fine.

#### Sauce

* Combine the ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, honey, and molasses.
* Mix until smooth.

#### Cooking

* Get your best non-stick[^stick] pan hot[^hot].
* Add all the batter, making a nice, large, circle.
* Let cook[^lid] until the bottom is ready (roughly 3 minutes).
* Slide the okonomiyaki onto a plate, then flip it back onto the pan[^flip].
* Brush the top of the okonomiyaki with sauce (while the bottom is cooking).
* Once the bottom is cooked, flip onto a plate.

[^stick]: This is a *sticky* batter. If you do not have a great non-stick pan, then I would abandon the idea of flipping the dish and just scrape it once done enough (at which point it starts making sense to cook it in an oven...).

[^hot]: As you would for pancakes.

[^lid]: Do *not* put a lid on; it would retain too much moisture.

[^flip]: You can take your time to do this flipping action, but yes, that is the difficult part of this recipe.

#### Garnishing

* Brush the okonomiyaki with sauce[^now].
* Add a generous swizzle of (Japanese) mayo.
* Sprinkle a very generous amount of bonito flakes.
* Sprinkle some nori.

[^now]: Now is the time to use all the sauce left.

This recipe is my take on [Joshua Weissman's recipe](https://youtu.be/S3TG5eLB-rw) (a Kansai-style okonomiyaki). I mostly removed the need for dashi and cut the seafood from the preparation[^seafood].

[^seafood]: Feel free to add it back! This is a great dish to make with some leftover seafood.
