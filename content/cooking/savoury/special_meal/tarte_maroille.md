This cheese pie recipe is a family secret.
It was passed down from my grandmother to my mother to me (my sister did not care for cooking at the time).
I am writing it so that it can be saved for future generations to enjoy (if you want to keep a secret, put it in writing).

## Ingredients (two pies):

#### Dought

* 1 kg of white flour
* 5 egg yolks
* 1 [cube of fresh yeast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baker%27s_yeast#/media/File:Compressed_fresh_yeast_-_1.jpg)[^yeast]
* a few spoonfuls of sugar (white is fine, brown is better, [cassonade/vergeoise](https://store.belgianshop.com/sugars/91-tirlemont-cassonade-graeffe-1kg.html) is traditional)
* 125 grams of salted butter (butter is good, salted is better)

[^yeast]: It is hard to find in the US, a sachet of dry yeast would be a fine substitute but result in a more homogeneous result.

#### Toping

* one egg,
* one egg's worth of milk,
* some grated nutmeg (optional)
* one big, full, [Maroille](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maroilles_cheese)[^maroille]

[^maroille]: This is a washed rind cheese with a strong smell, slightly sticky texture, and a pinkish color. It is typical from North France and very hard to replace in this recipe as most [similar cheeses](https://www.gourmetsleuth.com/ingredients/detail/maroilles-cheese) stay too strong once baked while Maroille's taste mellow enough for even non-cheese-lovers to love this pie.

## Preparation:

#### Dough

* Put the sugar and the yeast in a small bowl of warmish water[^water], mix once and let rest until it gets foamy
* put most of the flour in a large mixing bowl (set a little aside to shape the dough later)
* add the egg yolks and the yeast with its water
* mix until combined, do not over-mix (the resulting dough will be very sticky)
* cover with a towel and let rise for one hour (warmish places such as a window in the sun are best)

[^water]: My rule of thumb is that it should feel warm, so above body temperature, but no more than that. If you can burn your finger then it will kill your yeast.

#### Assembling the pie

* spread the dough on top of your pizza pans (you want flat pizza type of pans rather than pie pans), you can use the leftover flour to help shape the dough (do not use a rolling pin, this is a finger-stretching affair)
* add slices of Maroile on your dough (you want to cover it, the more the merrier)
* brush with a mix done with one egg and a little bit of milk (you can brush with your fingers)
* add a little bit of grounded nutmeg

## Cooking:

* Cook at 180C (350F) for 30 to 45 minutes (the crust should be hardened and the cheese pretty melted).
* Serve warm (while very fluffy, it gets heavier on the stomach cold)

## Credits:

This recipe was taught to me by my mother who inherited it from my grandmother (on my father's side).
Her only modification was to reduce the amount of butter (from 500 grams, my grandmother knew that butter is good stuff and was not afraid of using it).
