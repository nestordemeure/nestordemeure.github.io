This cheese pie recipe is a family secret.
It was past down from my grandmother to my mother to me (my sister did not care for cooking at the time).
I am writting it so that it can be saved for future generation to enjoy (if you want to keep a secret, put it in writting).

## Ingredients (two pies):

#### Dought

* 1kg of white flour
* 5 egg yolks
* 1 [cube of fresh yeast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baker%27s_yeast#/media/File:Compressed_fresh_yeast_-_1.jpg) (if you cannot find it, it is hard to find in the US, a paquet of dry yeast will be fine but result in a more homogeneous result)
* a few spoonful of suger (white is fine, brown is better, [cassonade/vergeoise](https://store.belgianshop.com/sugars/91-tirlemont-cassonade-graeffe-1kg.html) is traditional)
* 125 grams of salted butter (butter is good, salted is better)

#### Toping:

* one egg
* one egg's worth of milk
* some gratted nutmeg (optional)
* one big, full, [Maroille](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maroilles_cheese) (this is a washed rind cheese with a strong smell, slightly sticky texture and a pinkish color, typical from north France and very hard to replace in this recipe as most [similar cheeses](https://www.gourmetsleuth.com/ingredients/detail/maroilles-cheese) stay too strong once baked while Maroille's taste mellow enough for even non cheese lovers to love this pie)

## Preparation:

#### Dough

* put the sugar and the yeast in a sall bowl of warmish water (my rule of thumb is that it should feel warm, so above body temperature, but no more than that, if you can burn your finger then it will kill your yeast... I should maybe invest in a thermometer), mix once and let rest until it gets foamy
* put most of the flour in a large mixing bowl (set a little aside to shape the dough later)
* add the egg yolks and the yeast with its water
* mix until combined, do not overmix (the resulting dough will be very sticky)
* cover with a towel and let rise for one hour (warmish places such as a window in the sun are best)

#### Assembling the pie

* spread the dough on top of your pizza pans (you want flat pans rather than pie pans), you can use the leftover flour to help shape the dough (do not use a rollin pin, this is a finger streching affair)
* add slices of Maroile on your pan (you want to cover it, the more the merryier)
* brush with a mix done with one egg and a little bit of milk (you can brush with your fingers)
* add a little bit of grounded nutmeg

## Cooking:

* cook at 180C (350F) for 30 to 45 minutes (the crust should be hardened and the cheese pretty melted).
* serve warm (while very fluffy, it gets heavier on the stomach cold)

## Credits:

This recipe was taught to me by my mother who inherited it from my grandmother (on my father side).
Her only modification was to reduce the amount of butter (from 500 grams, my grandmother knew that butter is good stuff and was not afraid of using it).
