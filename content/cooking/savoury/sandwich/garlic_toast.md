This recipe will produce something flavorful, buttery, garlicy and tomato-y within minutes.

## Ingredients (one toast):

* one slice of bread (I recommend multigrain bread, it has more depth of flavor once toasted)
* 2 tablespoon of butter
* 1 clove garlic
* a handful of cherry tomatoes
* a similar amount of feta cheese

## Preparation:

* melt the butter in a microwave
* press the garlic and mix it with the butter[^wait]
* dice your cherry tomatoes in two or four
* prepare similarly shaped small rectangles of feta cheese

* toast the bread
* spread the garlic butter on the toast
* add the cheese and tomatoes

[^wait]: Preparing the garlic butter first gives it the strict minimum of time needed for the flavour to infuse in the butter.
