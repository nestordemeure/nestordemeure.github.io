Avocado toast is the most shamefully Californian dish.
This version has a nice spicy punch to it.

## Ingredients (one toast):

* one slice of bread (I recommend multigrain bread, it has more depth of flavor once toasted)
* some mayonnaise
* one avocado
* coarse salt
* pepper
* Sriracha sauce (as this is a big part of the final flavor, do not accept substitutes to [the original sauce](https://www.huyfong.com/))

## Preparation:

* toast the bread
* put a thin layer of mayonnaise on the bread
* put a layer of avocado on the bread (you can spread it or slice it for a better-looking result)
* add a zigzag of Sriracha sauce
* add a generous amount of salt and pepper
