This is the pinnacle of self-indulging food.
It is fast to prepare and very calorie-rich but the bacon, melted cheese, and toasted bread mesh perfectly and hit all the right spots.

## Ingredients (one toast):

* one or two slices of bacon[^1]
* one slice of bread (I recommend multigrain bread, it has more depth of flavor once toasted)
* some mayonnaise
* half a tomato
* coarse salt (optional)
* shredded cheese

[^1]: Bacon brings crispiness, salt, and flavor.
The obvious alternative for a non bacon-eater would be to use some vegan bacon, the taste and texture are not perfectly reproduced but it would work satisfactorily here.

## Preparation:

* cook the bacon in an oven or pan until crisp (note that it will give out *a lot* of fat, you could collect it for other recipes)
* toast the bread
* spread a thin layer of mayonnaise on the bread (it is there for some flavor notes but also to avoid having the tomato juice make the bread soggy)
* covers the bread with a one-slice thick layer of tomato
* sprinkle some salt
* add a layer of crispy bacon
* add a pile of shredded cheese *at the very least as thick as the rest of the sandwich* on top
* toast until the cheese is melted to your preference
* serve warm
