This is the pinnacle of self-indulging food.
It is fast to prepare and very calorie-rich but the bacon, melted cheese, and toasted bread mesh perfectly and hit all the right spots.

## Ingredients (one toast):

* one or two slices of bacon[^1]
* one slice of bread (I recommend multigrain bread, it has more depth of flavor once toasted)
* some mayonnaise
* half a tomato
* coarse salt (optional)
* shredded cheese

[^1]: Bacon brings crispiness, salt, and flavor.
The obvious alternative for a non-bacon-eater would be to use some vegan bacon, the taste and texture are not perfectly reproduced but it would work satisfactorily here.

## Preparation:

* cook the bacon until crisp[^bacon]
* toast the bread
* spread a thin layer of mayonnaise on the bread (it is there for some flavor notes but also to avoid having the tomato juice make the bread soggy)
* covers the bread with a one-slice thick layer of tomato
* sprinkle some salt
* add a layer of crispy bacon
* add a pile of shredded cheese *at the very least as thick as the rest of the sandwich* on top
* toast until the cheese is melted to your preference
* serve warm

[^bacon]: I recommend using a microwave. Put one or two slices of bacon on a plate, cover them with a paper towel and microwave until crisp (monitoring and taping away fat at regular intervals).
Once cooked, tap with another paper towel until dry and let rest 30 seconds so that it fully crisps.
