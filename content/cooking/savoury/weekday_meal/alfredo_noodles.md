This is my current lazy-day meal. It takes about 10 minutes to assemble this one-pot recipe which combines the lusciousness of Alfredo sauce with the richness of flavor brought by a handful of classic Japanese ingredients[^availability].

[^availability]: I do realize that buying furikake and bonito flakes solely for this dish makes little sense. But once you have them in your pantry, they stay good pretty much forever, and you can use them for a wide array of dishes.

## Ingredients (single serving):

* 1 pack of instant noodles[^noodles],
* roughly 30 grams of butter,
* a similar amount, by volume, of grated parmesan,
* freshly grated black pepper,
* chili flakes to taste,
* furikake to taste,
* bonito flakes[^bacon] to taste.

[^noodles]: I buy flat Asian, tagliatelle-like, noodles in bulk. They are not fried, unlike a lot of instant noodles, but still cook in less than 10 minutes. Classic instant noodles, Italian-style pasta, and even fresh pasta, would also work.

[^bacon]: Their smoky fishy flavor is best described as [fish bacon](https://youtu.be/LOSPsknh-gg).

## Preparation:

#### Pasta

* put the pasta in water and get it boiling[^warm] until cooked to your taste,
* reserve[^need] the pasta in a colander.

[^warm]: No need to start with boiling water. Putting the pasta straight into the water will get the dish done faster.

[^need]: You could also leave them in the pot if you drained them without colander, it is fine.

#### Sauce

* in the same pot, having cut the heat[^melt], drop the butter, parmesan, black pepper, and chili flakes,
* add the pasta and mix vigorously until well combined.

#### Assembly

* transfer the pasta to a bowl,
* sprinkle with furikake to taste,
* add a generous amount of bonito flakes on top.

[^melt]: The residual heat in the pasta should be enough; any high heat would prevent the emulsion of the butter and cheese.
