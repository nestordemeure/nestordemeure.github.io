This is a summer favorite. I keep an heirloom tomato in my pantry to be able to cook it on the spot.

## Ingredients (for two portions):

* 160 grams of pasta[^pasta] (80 grams per person)  
* some salt  
* a splash of olive oil  
* chili flakes to taste  
* pepper to taste  
* the equivalent of one and a half large cloves of garlic  
* one big heirloom tomato[^tomato]  
* about 30 grams of butter  

[^pasta]: Ideally, you want pasta that will catch the sauce, such as bronze-cut pasta, but you do you.  

[^tomato]: You want a *large* (apple-sized) *ripe* (it should feel like it could burst if you mishandle it) one, it will make enough sauce for one to two people. I like to get a yellow or orange one to give my pasta sauce an unusual color. Out of season, I would fall back to cherry tomatoes.  

## Preparation:

#### Pasta  

* Put the pasta and salt[^salt-water] in a pan.  
* Add water[^boil].  
* Cook for about 15 minutes on high heat (until your pasta is cooked).  

[^salt-water]: Do not skip the salt; it will salt both the sauce and the pasta.  

[^boil]: You are reading this correctly; I start with cold water.  

#### Sauce  

* Put the olive oil in a wok.  
* Add the pepper, chili flakes, and crushed garlic.  
* Start cooking the oil until it becomes fragrant[^oil].  
* Meanwhile, dice the tomato.  
* Add the diced tomato (and all its juice) when the garlic starts overcooking.  
* Mash it as it cooks, then let it simmer until the pasta is ready.  

[^oil]: Be careful not to overdo it and let your garlic burn.  

#### Assembly  

* Once the pasta is cooked, add a splash of pasta water to the wok; this will help with the consistency of the sauce.  
* Strain the pasta and add it to the wok (some leftover pasta water is fine).  
* Start mixing on high heat until you reach a sauce slightly *drier* than what you want[^consistency].  
* Take the wok off the heat, add the diced butter, and mix vigorously until it is completely melted.  

[^consistency]: This will ensure good coating of the pasta.
