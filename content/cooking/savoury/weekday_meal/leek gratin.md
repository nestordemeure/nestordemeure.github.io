I absolutely love this recipe. It is dead easy, legitimately 2 ingredients -- the leek juice and melted cheese combining to make the sauce --, delicious but unlikely to weight you down.
Very much worth cooking when leeks are in season, and you want something warm and cheesy to pick up your soul.

## Ingredients:

* 2 big leeks[^leek]
* 1 full[^full] Roblochon[^rob]

[^leek]: Enough to cover the bottom of your pan.

[^full]: Enough to cover the top of your pan.

[^rob]: If you cannot procure Roblochon where you live, ask your favorite cheese vendor for their closest equivalent, it will do.

## Cooking:

* Cut the leeks into 1cm slices then cook them in salted water until they reach your favorite consistency[^consistency]
* drain the leeks carefully in a colander then transfer them to the bottom of you cooking pan
* put a layer of cheese slices on top of the leeks
* cook in an oven at 350F (180C) until the cheese is melted and crispy to your preference[^cook]
* eat hot

[^consistency]: I like to reach the point where they can barely hold themselves together.

[^cook]: The point of this step is to cook the cheese, the leeks are already done.

## Credits:

This particular take on the recipe came straight from a French book of recipe whose name sadly escapes me at the moment.
The recipe diverges from the vast majority of gratins in that it does not have a carb, making it significantly lighter on the stomach.
