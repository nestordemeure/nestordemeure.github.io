While this is a quick way to pimp up cheap instant noodles, turning them into a pasta dish that feels fancy, this buttered gochujang sauce can also be used to elevate any kind of pasta.

## Ingredients (single serving):

* 1 pack of instant noodles
* 2 cloves of garlic
* 2 big tablespoons of salted butter
* 1 big teaspoon gochujang paste[^gochujang]
* 1 tablespoon of sherry or rice vinegar
* 1 tablespoon honey
* scallions (optional)

[^gochujang]: Not sauce, which often include additives like sugar and vinegar.

## Preparation:

#### Pasta

* put the instant noodles in boiling water
* cook to your desired consistency

#### Sauce

* press[^dice] the garlic *first*
* melt the butter in a pan
* as soon as the butter starts sizzling, add the garlic and mix
* add the gochujang, vinegar, and honey
* bring to a boil while mixing then let rest while waiting for the pasta to be ready

[^dice]: You could dice it finely, but a garlic press is a great way to extract a maximum of flavor out of a given quantity of garlic.

#### Assembly

* add the noodles and a splash of pasta water to the sauce
* add one teaspoon of butter
* mix on high heat until well coated
* transfer to a bowl
* optionally sprinkle diced scallions on top
