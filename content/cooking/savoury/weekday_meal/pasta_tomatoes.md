This is an easy pasta dish that has a surprising depth of flavor.

## Ingredients (for two portions):

* 160 grams of pasta[^pasta] (80 grams per person)
* some salt
* some olive oil
* a generous amount of pepper
* the equivalent of one and a half large cloves of garlic
* a dozen leaves of basil[^basil]
* 100 grams (roughly) of cherry tomatoes[^cherry]
* optionally about 30 grams of butter

[^pasta]: I prefer to use long thin pasta such as spaghetti or tagliatelle for this recipe.
Ideally, you want pasta that will catch the sauce such as bronze-cut pasta but, you do not need to go that fancy with your ingredients here.

[^basil]: Be careful not to use too much basil, it can quickly become overpowering and almost bitter.

[^cherry]: They tend to be sweeter and more flavorful. If you have good, flavorful, normal tomatoes then feel free to dice and use them.

## Preparation:

#### Mise en place

* rince the basil leaves and dice them very finely
* crush the garlic
* cut the cherry tomatoes in fourth[^blend]

[^blend]: You could blend them for a smooth sauce, but a bit of homogeneity is not bad and makes the recipe easier and faster.

#### Pasta

* fill a pan with water and bring it to a boil
* add a generous amount of salt to your pasta water[^salt-water]
* add the pasta when the water starts boiling and keep cooking for about 10 minutes (until your pasta is cooked)

[^salt-water]: The pasta will taste better *and* it will help to salt the sauce later.

#### Sauce

* put the olive oil in a wok
* add a very generous amount of pepper and cook on high heat until the pepper becomes fragrant[^pepper]
* add the crushed garlic and finely diced basil
* add the tomatoes
* let simmer until the pasta are ready

[^pepper]: Be careful not to overdo it and let your pepper burn.

#### Assembly

* once the pasta is cooked, add a splash of pasta water to the wok, this will help with the consistency of the sauce
* strain the pasta and add them to the wok (it is fine if there is some pasta water left with the pasta, we added pasta water to the wok anyway)
* optionally add the diced butter
* start mixing on high heat until you reach the desired consistency[^consistency]

[^consistency]: I recommend aiming for slightly more liquid than your sweet spot, the sauce will thicken further once served
