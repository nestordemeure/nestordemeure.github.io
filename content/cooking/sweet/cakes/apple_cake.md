This recipe is simple, surprisingly delicious, lets the apple shine through, and yet can be done with flavourless leftover apples.

## Ingredients (one square cake pan):

* 3 large apples
* 2 teaspoon apple cider vinegar[^vinegar]
* 115 grams of salted butter
* 100 grams of white sugar
* 2 teaspoon of *brown* sugar (about 30 grams)
* 2 large eggs
* 1 large teaspoon vanilla extract[^vanilla]
* 120 grams flour
* 1 teaspoon baking powder

[^vinegar]: This helps brings in further apple flavor, which is particularly important if your apples are not that good.

[^vanilla]: The traditional recipe calls for half a teaspoon of vanilla extract but adds 3 tablespoons of dark rhum.

## Preparation:

* finely dice the apples[^skin]
* toss with the apple cider vinegar and reserve

* mix the butter[^soft], white sugar and brown sugar in a large bowl
* beat the eggs and vanilla in
* add the flour and baking powder, fold the mixture
* fold in the apples

* pour the batter into a buttered pan
* dust a thin layer of white sugar on top[^dust]

[^skin]: Keep the skin, it makes the recipe easier, does not degrade the final result and is probably healthier.

[^soft]: You can, very lightly, soften the butter in a microwave to make your task easier.

[^dust]: Do not omit this step, it makes a significant improvement in the flavour and brings some textural contrast to the cake.

## Cooking:

* cook 45 minutes in a 350F (180C) oven
* let cool down to room temperature before serving

This is my take on [Chef John's recipe](https://youtu.be/fOx59nDPIhg) (the irony of using an American recipe to bake a French cake is not lost on me).
