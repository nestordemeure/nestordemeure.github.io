* walnuts (optional)
* cooking chocolate[^taste]

* 240 grams flour
* 1 teaspoon baking powder
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* one big pinch of cayenne pepper (optional)

[^taste]: Not much, this is not a chocolate cake.

## Preparation:

* mix the sugar in
* mix and mash the bananas in[^mixture]
* mix in the eggs

* chop the walnuts and add to taste
* chop the chocolate and add to taste

* mix the flour, baking powder, baking soda and cayenne paper in, until just barely integrated
