Mug cakes tend to be dry, this one succeeds at being reasonably moist and tasting like... Chocapic breakfast cereals?

## Ingredients (1 large mug)

* 30 grams salted butter
* 50 grams sugar
* 15 ml olive oil[^oil]
* 1 large egg[^banana]
* 12 grams unsweetened cocoa powder
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 45 ml milk
* 30 grams flour
* 1 gram baking powder

[^oil]: This, and limiting the time in the microwave, is the secret to a moist cake.

[^banana]: You can replace the egg with 2/3 of a very ripe banana. The batter will look weird, and it will need an additional minute in the microwave, but the result is delicious.

## Preparation

* melt the butter in your mug[^mug]
* whisk together the melted butter, sugar, oil, egg, cocoa, and vanilla until smooth
* add milk and whisk until combined
* add flour and baking powder, folding gently until you no longer see dry flour (don't overmix)

[^mug]: You could also do two smaller coffee-cups worth of cake, in which case you will want to reduce the baking time.

## Cooking

* microwave on high for 1 minute 30 seconds[^time]
* let rest for a couple minutes before eating

[^time]: Depending on your microwave, start checking at 45 seconds. The cake should rise, look set on top but still be moist on the  inside.
