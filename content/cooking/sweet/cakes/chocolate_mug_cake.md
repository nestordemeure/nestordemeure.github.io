Mug cakes tend to be dry, this one succeeds at being reasonably moist and tasting like... Chocapic breakfast cereals?

## Ingredients (1 large mug)

* 30 grams salted butter
* 1 large egg
* 50 grams sugar
* 12 grams unsweetened cocoa powder
* 15 ml olive oil[^oil]
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 45 ml milk
* 30 grams flour
* 1 gram baking powder

[^oil]: This is the secret to a moist cake.

## Preparation

* melt the butter in your mug
* whisk together the melted butter, sugar, oil, egg, cocoa, and vanilla until smooth
* add milk and whisk until combined
* add flour and baking powder, folding gently until you no longer see dry flour (don't overmix)

## Cooking

* microwave on high for 1 minute 30 seconds[^time]
* let rest for a couple minutes before eating

[^time]: Depending on your microwave, start checking at 45 seconds. The cake should rise, look set on top but still be moist on the  inside.
