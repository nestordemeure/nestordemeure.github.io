This recipe produces a very nicely moist chocolate cake with rich chocolate flavor.
Perfect when your main requirement for a cake is that it should be *"chocolate flavored."*

## Ingredients:

* 240 grams flour
* 125 grams sugar
* 9 grams baking soda
* 28 grams cocoa powder
* 227 grams salted butter
* 227 grams (1 cup) water
* 2 large eggs
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 113 grams yogurt[^cream]

[^cream]: The original recipe used sour cream, which you can substitute if you have it on hand for a slightly tangier flavor.

## Preparation:

* mix the flour, sugar, baking soda, and cocoa powder in a large bowl
* mix the butter and boiling hot water in a bowl until dissolved[^hot]
* add the butter mixture to the dry ingredients
* add the eggs and vanilla extract
* add the yogurt and mix well

[^hot]: The original recipe mixed the cocoa powder with the water and butter over heat (as if making a sort of hot cocoa). I went with this faster option, you could also warm the butter and water in a microwave.

## Cooking:

* bake at 350°F (180°C) for 50 minutes in a buttered pan[^bundt]
* let cool before serving
* you can optionally make a quick ganache[^ganache] to pour over the cooled cake for added textural contrast

[^bundt]: A bundt pan will make it look much fancier, but you will need to *generously* butter it to prevent sticking.

[^ganache]: Here, a mix of melted chocolate and water (or milk).
