This is a recipe for a basic yellow mug cake.
It might be a bit dry but it is perfect when you want cake in under five minutes.
Feel free to add fruits, lemon juice/zests, chocolate chunks, or anything else really, to make it fancy!

## Ingredients (one bowl of cake):

* 1 egg[^small]
* 2 tablespoons of sugar
* 4 tablespoons of flour
* 1 teaspoon of baking powder[^powder]
* 3 tablespoons of milk
* 1 tablespoon of salted butter[^unit]

[^small]: The smallest you have on hand will be perfect.

[^powder]: Don't hesitate to be generous with the baking powder. This cake can tend to be too compact.

[^unit]: I know, it is a terrible measuring unit for butter. However, here we are going for easy no-fuss measurements so spoons it is.
In a pinch, you can replace the butter with olive oil.

## Preparation:

* mix the egg with the sugar
* add the flour and baking powder, mix
* add the milk, mix
* melt the butter in the microwave, add it and mix
* add any additional (flavoring) ingredient

## Cooking:

* microwave about 1min20[^time]

[^time]: Baking time will vary depending on your microwave. If your mug cake needs more cooking, add time in slices of 10 seconds until you are happy with the result.
