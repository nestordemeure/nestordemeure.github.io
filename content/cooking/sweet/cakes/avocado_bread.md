This recipe is simple, tastes good, has an interesting texture and, more importantly, looks extremely weird making it a fantastic party dessert.

## Ingredients (one rectangular cake pan):

* 2 (very ripe) avocados
* 100 grams of sugar
* 3 eggs
* 240 grams of flour
* 6 grams (one and a half) teaspoon of baking powder

## Preparation:

* dice the inside of the avocados and put them in a large bowl
* cream[^cream] the avocados and sugar together
* beat the eggs into the mix
* add the flour and baking powder
* fold together

[^cream]: I do it with a fork, which leaves some heterogeneity. One could also use a stand mixer.

## Cooking:

* cook for 30 to 35 minutes in a 350F (180C) oven
