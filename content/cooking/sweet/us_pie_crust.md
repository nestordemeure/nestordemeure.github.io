This pie dough is easy to make and tastes pretty much perfect for a US-style pie (with crust below and above the pie).
Plus, the leftover dough can be stored in the fridge for later use.

## Ingredients (for one pie):

* 300 grams of flour
* 20 grams of sugar (optional)
* 227 grams of salted butter (get it out of the fridge as soon as you start to raise its temperature and make your job easier)
* 53 grams of water
* 8 grams of apple cider vinegar (*needs testing to see how impactful it is*)

## Preparation:

* put the flour in a large bowl
* add the sugar
* add the butter diced or sliced into thin slices (to simplify the mixing)
* with one hand mix the dough until you get a crumbly/flaky consistency
* add half of the water plus the vinegar and mix
* add the leftover water and mix into a ball
* cut the ball in two and refrigerate for 30 minutes while you prepare the fillings

## Cooking:

* You might want to prebake the bottom of our pie (for a European-style pie) or let your pie cook for a long time.
* once the pie is assembled, you can brush the top with some milk (to get a slight shine after cooking) and sprinkle a generous amount of sugar

I barely added sugar, used salted butter, and translated the measurements to grams.
