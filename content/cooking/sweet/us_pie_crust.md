This pie dough is easy to make and taste pretty much perfect for a US style pie (with crust below and above the pie).
Plus, leftover dough can be stored in the fridge for later use.

## Ingredients (for one pie):

* 300 grams of flour
* 20 grams of sugar (optional)
* 227 grams of salted butter (get it out of the fridge as soon as you start to raise its temperature and make your job easier)
* 53 grams of water
* 8 grams of apple cider vinegar (*needs testing to see how impactful it is*)

## Preparation:

* put the flour in a large bowl
* add the sugar
* add the butter diced or sliced into thin slice (to simplify the mixing)
* with one hand mix the dough until you get a crumbly / flaky consistency
* add half of the water plus the vinegar and mix
* add the leftover water and mix into a ball

## Cooking:

* You might want to prebake the bottom of our pie (for a European style pie) or let you pie cook for a long time.

## Credits:

I barely added sugar, used salted butter and translated the measurements to grams.
