This is a very straightforward chocolate brownies recipe.
You can pimp it up with some coffee powder[^coffee], a few salt flakes on top, any kind of nuts, chocolate chunks, etc.
The world is your chocolate-flavored oyster!

[^coffee]: It is a classic method to increase the chocolate flavor.
I highly recommend going overboard and adding 10 grams of finely ground instant coffee to make coffee-flavored brownies.

## Ingredients (8 slices):

* 100 grams of flour
* 37 grams of cocoa powder
* 125 grams of sugar
* 2 eggs
* 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract (optional)
* 100 grams of salted butter

## Preparation:

* mix the flour and cocoa in a bowl
* add the sugar and mix
* beat the eggs and add
* add the vanilla extract
* [melt the butter](/cooking/technique/melting_butter), add it and mix
* pour in a pan lined with parchment paper

## Cooking:

* cook 25 to 30 minutes in a 340F (170C) oven
* let cool in the pan before serving (they might be best served the next day for peak flavor and texture)

This is my take on Sarah Beeny's chocolate brownies recipe (with which [she beat Gordon Ramsay on British television](https://youtu.be/usfNJCHCVLw)).
I mostly reduced the sugar levels and defaulted to salted butter (which makes everything better).
