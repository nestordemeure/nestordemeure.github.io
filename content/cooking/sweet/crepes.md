Crêpes are the perfect social dish.
You can make them together then everyone put the topping of their choice on top, sweet or savory[^1].

[^1]: I am not covering topping here but cheese, charcuterie and salmon are classics for savory Crêpes while jam and sugar are very common for sweet crepes.

## Ingredients (4 people):

* 250 grams flour
* 4 eggs
* 500 ml milk
* 50 salted butter (a pinch of salt and 40 grams of olive oil, the taste is slightly different but it works)
* 25 grams of sugar

## Preparation:

* put the flout in a mixing bowl
* add the sugar
* add the salt
* add the eggs and mix
* add the milk progressively while mixing
* add the melted butter (making sure it is not ht enough to cook the eggs prematurely) and mix

## Cooking:

* slightly oil (or butter) a pan
* put a ladle worth of crêpe batter and spread it to make it round
* once the bottom is cooked (the sides should start to get browned), use a spoon and flip it (it should cook for about a minute)
* repeat as many times as needed
