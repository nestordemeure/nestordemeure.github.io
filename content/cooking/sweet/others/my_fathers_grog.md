This is a recipe my father used to make when we were sick as children, with clogged noses and painful throats.
I have fond memories of him going out to cut herbs in the garden, then returning to prepare this warming drink.

## Ingredients (2 servings):

* 500 ml (2 cups) water
* 1 teaspoon dried thyme (or 1 tablespoon fresh thyme)
* 1 teaspoon dried sage (or 1 tablespoon fresh sage)
* 1 star anise (optional)
* 2 tablespoons cane sugar (or honey to taste)
* 1 small orange or lemon (juice + peel)
* 60 ml (about 4 tablespoons) dark rum[^rum]

[^rum]: You can reduce it to taste. But yes, it is an alcoholized sick children's drink.

## Preparation:

* In a small pot, combine water, thyme, sage, star anise (if using), and sugar
* Cut the citrus into wedges or slices, squeeze in the juice, then drop the peel in too
* Bring to a gentle boil, then simmer for 5–7 minutes
* Remove from heat and let infuse 2–3 minutes
* Stir in the rum
* Taste and add honey if you want it sweeter
* Strain into glasses and drink hot
