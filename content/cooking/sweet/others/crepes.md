Crêpes are the perfect social dish. You can make them together, then everyone puts the toppings[^toppings] of their choice on top, sweet or savory[^savory].

[^toppings]: I am not covering toppings here, but cheese, charcuterie, and salmon are classics for savory crêpes, while jam and sugar are very common for sweet crêpes.

[^savory]: Savory crêpes are best made with buckwheat flour. You will find a good recipe [here](https://www.cookwell.com/recipe/galette-complete).

## Ingredients (4 people):

* 250 grams flour
* 25 grams sugar
* 4 eggs
* 500 ml milk
* 50 grams salted butter (or 40 grams olive oil and a pinch of salt, the taste is slightly different but it works)

## Preparation:

* Put the flour in a mixing bowl.
* Add the sugar.
* Add the eggs and mix.
* Add the milk progressively while mixing.
* Add the melted butter (making sure it is not hot enough to cook the eggs prematurely) and mix.

## Cooking:

* Slightly oil (or butter) the pan.
* Put a ladle worth of crêpe batter and spread it to make it round.
* Once the bottom is cooked (the sides should start to get browned), use a spatula and flip it (it should cook for about a minute).
* Repeat as many times as needed.
