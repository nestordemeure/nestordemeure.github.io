Those cookies are very worth doing.
They focus the flavor on the red bean paste while looking fancier than they are difficult to cook (which is always a good thing).

## Ingredients (2 person):

* 1 egg
* 50 grams of salted butter
* 100 grams of flour
* 25 grams of icing sugar[^sugar]
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 100 grams of red bean paste[^bean]
* optional: 1 additional egg for brushing[^egg]
* optional: sesame seeds

[^sugar]: Also known as powdered sugar in the Americas. In a pitch, you can blend some white sugar or just use the same weight of white sugar.

[^bean]: You can [make it yourself](https://www.justonecookbook.com/how-to-make-anko-red-bean-paste/) but it is significantly easier to just buy it (you will find it in Asian grocery stores or even on the Internet).
Cr√®me de marron (chestnut cream) would be an acceptable substitute.

[^egg]: This would be enough for 6 people's worth of cookies.

## Preparation:

#### Cookie dough

* whisk the egg in a bowl
* add the softened[^soft] butter and mix until homogeneous
* add the flour, icing sugar and vanilla extract
* mix until smooth[^enough]
* cover and refrigerate for one hour

[^soft]: You can leave it on the counter until it is soft or microwave it for 10 to 20 seconds.

[^enough]: Here you might think that you do not have enough dough. Don't worry, it will be enough.

#### Assembly

* get the dough on a *floured*[^stick] surface
* using a rolling pin, shape the dough into a long rectangle
* shape the red bean paste into a thick bar and place it in the middle of the rectangle
* carefully fold the two sides of the rectangle over the bar and flip it to put the seam down
* cut the resulting bar of dough into squarish cookies

[^stick]: The dough will be sticky.

#### Decoration

* whisk the additional egg and brush the cookies with it[^brush]
* sprinkle some sesame seeds on the cookies

[^brush]: You can use a brush or your fingers.

#### Baking

* bake 20 to 25 minutes at 360F (180C)
* let cool down a little before eating
