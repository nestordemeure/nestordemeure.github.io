This drink is quick and easy to make, tastes like an [éclair au café](https://www.meilleurduchef.com/en/recipe/coffee-eclairs.html), and looks very pretty.
It is perfect to share with a guest who likes coffee.

## Ingredients (1 glass):

* two teaspoons of instant coffee[^coffee]
* two teaspoons of sugar
* two teaspoons of boiling water
* one glass of *very* cold whole[^whole] milk[^ice]

[^coffee]: This will make or break the taste of the resulting drink.
I recommend investing in some fancy instant coffee (I had good results with *"Trader's Joe 100% Colombian instant coffee"*).

[^whole]: There is no point in skimming on the milk, it will be an important component of the final taste.

[^ice]: Some people add ice cubes but I think it goes against the result being a quick drink.

## Preparation:

* mix the instant coffee, sugar, and boiling water in a bowl
* whip until the color lightens and the texture becomes fluffier[^whip]
* pour the coffee foam[^foam] on top of a glass of very cold milk
* to serve add a straw, let guests mix, and start drinking

[^whip]: Whipping will become more effective as the syrup cools down.

[^foam]: The foam is essentially coffee syrup and will taste very bitter by itself.

## Credits:

This recipe was inspired by seeing [James Hoffman discuss the drink on his youtube channel](https://youtu.be/WHmpgMsW-aA).
I highly recommend his videos for people with an analytical interest in coffee.
