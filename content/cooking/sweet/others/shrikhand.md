[Shrikhand](https://www.howtopronounce.com/shrikhand) is an Indian, Gujarati and Marathi, dessert made primarily with yogurt and cardamom.
It is quick to make, looks quite fancy, and has a nice richness of flavor: basically a *fancy Indian yogurt*.

## Ingredients (1 small bowl):

* 1 small bowl of dry[^dry] Greek[^yogurt] yogurt
* Unsalted nuts[^nuts] to taste
* Dried grapes to taste (optional)
* A hazelnut-sized[^pinch] amount of salted butter
* 1/2 teaspoon of cardamom powder
* 1/4 teaspoon of saffron threads
* Powdered sugar to taste

[^dry]: You could have it wait overnight in a cheesecloth, press the liquid out, or you can eat only the half side of your yogurt tub which causes the uneaten side to start drying by itself within a day or two.

[^yogurt]: Normal, full-fat, unsweetened yogurt will do in a pinch, as will, obviously, proper Indian curd.

[^nuts]: Pistachios and almonds would be traditional, but any nuts you have in your pantry will do.

[^pinch]: I do realize that so far the measurement units are terrible.

## Preparation:

#### Saffron

* Grind or chop the saffron finely (reserve some threads for garnish)
* Mix it and let it bloom in a teaspoon[^water] of hot water

[^water]: Very little, we do not want to make our final yogurt watery.

#### Nuts

* Chop the nuts finely (reserve some for garnishing)
* Roast the nuts, until fragrant, with the dried grapes and butter[^butter] in a small pan

[^butter]: Do not be afraid to let the butter brown.

#### Yogurt

* Pass the yogurt through a fine sieve[^need]
* Add the nuts, spices, and sugar
* Mix until smoothly combined
* Garnish with the reserved chopped nuts and saffron threads

[^need]: This step is necessary to get the typical creamy texture of the dish.

## Credits:

I learned about the dish's existence, as well as the idea of blooming nuts in butter, in [Bon App√©tit's *Pro Chefs Give 26 Cooking Tips for Every Letter A-Z* video](https://youtu.be/_LyR8Nhzoxw).
The final dish is a personal mix of several recipes I saw online and techniques I am familiar with.
