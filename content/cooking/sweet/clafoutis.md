Clafoutis were my favorite kind of cake when I was a kid. My mother used to make plum ones while fruits were in season and I famously ate a full cake who just got out of the oven while she was away of the kitchen.
They are also a great way to turn fruits into a cake that looks very pretty while being extremely easy to make.

## Ingredients:

* about 500grams (you want to cover your pan with a nice layer) of a mix of cherries and apricots (stones fruits such as cherries, plums apricots and peaches feel like a better match but it works with pretty much anything including bananas and rhubarb, I like a mix of cherries and apricots to vary colors and flavors)
* 4 eggs
* 100 grams of flour
* 60 grams of salted butter (you could use olive oil and some salt, the taste would differ but that still makes for a good cake)
* 100 grams of sugar (could be reduced according to taste)
* 25cl of milk
* some vanilla extract (optional)

## Preparation:

#### The pan

* put a generous amount of butter on the sides of your cake pan (you want a wider rather than tall pan)
* cut your fruits (stones fruits can be cut into two or four, don't forget to remove the stone, you can leave the skin on) and spread them in the cake pan

#### The batter

* mix the eggs with the sugar until smooth
* add the (optional) vanilla extract
* add the flour while mixing
* add the milk while mixing
* melt the butter in a microwave (or oven but 30 seconds in a microwave is perfect) then add (if the butter is warm, mix it fast enough to not cook your egg)
* pour the batter in your cake pan (the batter will be more golden and liquid than usual cake batter, it is perfectly normal)

## Cooking:

* cook 30 to 45 minutes at 350F (180C), you can stop once the top is golden and the batter firm
* serve at room temperature (it is also great cold after a few hours in the fridge)
* you can (optionally) dust the top with powdered white sugar just before serving if you are serving cold (this is purely esthetic)

## Credits

This clafoutis batter is pretty classic and can be found all over the web.
The fruit selection is mine but probably not original.
