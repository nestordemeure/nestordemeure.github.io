This breakfast manages to both be delicious and give you the feeling that you are eating healthy. And it feels good.
I get the needed ingredients about once a month to eat it for a few days (I feel that eating it every day would reduce my enjoyment).

## Ingredients (1 bowl):

* two tablespoons of granola[^granola]
* two tablespoons of unsweetened coconut milk yogurt[^yogurt]
* two tablespoons of blueberries
* a few strawberries[^fruit]

[^granola]: You want the [sticky, sweet kind](https://cookieandkate.com/healthy-granola-recipe/) (rather than the dry grain kind), This will be your main source of sugar with the fruits.

[^yogurt]: The coconut taste is a plus here. I would *not* use a traditional yogurt (I want something tasting fresher) but something like French fromage blanc could do the trick.

[^fruit]: You can obviously change the fruits. Frozen raspberries taste great here.

## Preparation:

* put the granola in a bowl
* add the yogurt
* wash and add the blueberries
* wash, dice and add the stawberries
