This is a great pie dough for most open-style pies.
It is rich in butter and tastes great by itself, even raw!

## Ingredients (for one pie):

* 75 grams of sugar
* 1 egg
* 250 grams of flour
* 100 grams of salted butter[^butter]

[^butter]: Get it out of the fridge as soon as possible so that it can start to soften.

## Preparation:

* mix the sugar and egg in a large bowl
* add the flour
* dice the butter and add it to the mix
* mix until homogeneous[^hands]

[^hands]: Mixing with your hand should make the process faster, the butter getting softer in contact with your body warm.

## Cooking:

* use a rolling pin to flatten the dough before putting it in the pie pan
* add the sweet pie fillings of your choice
* you might want to prebake the pie crust for about 10 minutes at 180C (350F)

This is my take on [Marmiton's Pâte sablée recipe](https://www.marmiton.org/recettes/recette_pate-sablee_14540.aspx).
However, Pâte sablée is a classic pie crust and most recipes are very similar.
