This is a great pie dough for most open-style pies.
It is rich in butter and tastes great by itself, even raw!

## Ingredients (for one pie):

* 75 grams of sugar
* 1 egg
* 250 grams of flour
* 100 grams of salted butter[^butter]

[^butter]: Get it out of the fridge as soon as possible so that it can start to soften.

## Preparation:

* mix the sugar and egg in a large bowl
* add the flour
* dice the butter and add it to the mix
* mix until homogeneous[^hands]

[^hands]: You want to use a press and squeeze motion, applying some physical strength, folding the dough until it becomes homogeneous and you cannot see blocks of butter.
The process gets easier as the dough warms up to your hands.

## Cooking:

* use a rolling pin to flatten the dough before putting it in the pie pan
* add the sweet pie fillings[^fillings] of your choice
* you might want to prebake the pie crust for about 10 minutes at 180C (350F)

[^fillings]: Such as this [beautiful rhubarb and frangipane filling](https://www.tastefrance.com/us/recipes/french-rhubarb-tart).

## Credits:

This is my take on [Marmiton's Pâte sablée recipe](https://www.marmiton.org/recettes/recette_pate-sablee_14540.aspx).
However, Pâte sablée is a classic pie crust and most recipes are very similar.
