This is the perfect recipe to do when you have leftover egg whites. It is delicious and uses barely any ingredients (I always keep the proper chocolate in my pantry to do this recipe when I have egg whites).
Its only downside is that, once you have prepared everything, you need to *wait*.

## Ingredients (1 portion):

* 1 egg whites[^1]
* 35 grams of chocolate[^2]

[^1]: Don't despair if you have some full eggs, you will be able to use the egg yolks later in the recipe.
[^2]: This is the only source of sugar for the dessert so I recommend aiming for slightly sweeter than your sweet spot. I like to go with 70% cacao.

## Preparation:

* beat your egg whites into a nice firm foam
* melt the chocolate (it is okay to leave some chunks in the melted chocolate, they will add heterogeneity to the result)
* optionally, if you have egg yolks, add them to the melted chocolate and mix until homogeneous (be careful not to cook them in the hot chocolate)
* fold the melted chocolate into the egg whites
* pour into one glass, mug, or bowl per portion
* store in the fridge for *at least 5 hours* (you can wait a full night if you want to be sure)
* eat cold (you can shave some chocolate on top if you want to make it look fancy)

## Credits:

The proportions are inspired by this [Mousse au chocolat facile](https://www.marmiton.org/recettes/recette_mousse-au-chocolat-facile_13585.aspx) recipe.
My main contribution is to experiment with the recipe to see how far I could simplify it.
