I am a consulting mentalist (I have a book published for that public and I designed a stage show amongst other things).

## What is mentalism?

Mentalism is an ensemble of techniques (including mnemotechnic, hypnosis, magic tricks, knowledge of statistically likely phenomenons, and a trained intuition) used to produce incredible phenomenons (usually psychic phenomenons or an impressive mastery of the human mind) in an entertainment setting.

One point that is worth stressing is that it is *neither* all real (magic tricks are great to make things look better / add some punch and anyone telling you they don't use them is either lying or very ignorant) *nor* all fake (anyone telling you otherwise is, similarly, likely ignorant or a magician who did some telepathy-themed tricks and think that it is all there is to it, the human mind is an amazing toy).

If you want to be entertained by a world-class mentalist, I highly recommend [watching some Derren Brown shorts on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/OfficialDerren).

## What does a consulting mentalist do?

Usually, people contact me because they want to do a particular demonstration on stage and I find a way to do it given their skill set, constraints, and theme.
But it can also be building a full show around a theme or helping someone track older references on a subject they are researching.

## How do I contact you?

Whether you are a mentalist that needs my service or just a layman curious about the subject, you can reach me by [email](mailto:nestordemeure+mentalism@gmail.com).
